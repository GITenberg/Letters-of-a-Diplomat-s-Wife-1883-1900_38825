<h2>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</h2>

<h2>BY THE COLLECTOR OF THE LETTERS</h2>


<p>Mary Alsop King Waddington is a daughter
of the late Charles King, President of Columbia College
in the City of New York from 1849 to 1864, and a
granddaughter of Rufus King, the second Minister sent
to England by the United States after the adoption of
the Constitution.</p>

<p>Miss King was educated in this country. In 1871,
after the death of her father, she went, with her mother
and sisters, to live in France, and in 1874 became the
wife of M. William Henry Waddington.</p>

<p>M. Waddington was born in Normandy, France, in
1826. His grandfather was an Englishman who had
established cotton manufactories in France, and had become
a naturalised French citizen. The grandson, however,
was educated first in a Paris <em>lyc&eacute;e</em>, then at Rugby,
and later at Trinity College, Cambridge. As an undergraduate
he rowed in the Cambridge boat in the University
race of 1849. Soon after leaving the University,
M. Waddington returned to France and entered public
life. In 1871 he was elected a representative from the
Department of the Aisne to the National Assembly, and
two years afterward was appointed Minister of Public
Instruction in place of M. Jules Simon. In January,
1876, he was elected a senator for the Department of
the Aisne, and two months later again became Minister
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_vi" title="pg vi"> </a>
of Public Instruction. In December, 1877, he accepted
the portfolio of Minister of Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p>M. Waddington was the first plenipotentiary of
France to the Congress of Berlin in 1878. On February
4, 1879, he became President of the Council (Premier),
retiring the following December. In the winter of 1879-1880
he refused the offer of the London Embassy. In
May, 1883, he was sent as Ambassador-Extraordinary to
represent France at the coronation of the Czar Alexander
III at Moscow, and upon his return from Russia
was appointed Ambassador at the Court of St. James
to succeed M. Tissot. He held this post until 1893,
and died in Paris in the following year.</p>

<p>Mme. Waddington accompanied her husband on his
missions to both England and Russia. The letters collected
in this volume were written during the period
of her husband's diplomatic service to describe to her
sisters the personages and incidents of her official life.
About a fourth part of their number have lately been
published in <em>Scribner's Magazine</em>; with this exception,
the letters are now given to the public for the first time.</p>

31, Rue Dumont d'Urville,<br >
March 15, 1883.</p>

<p>Our breakfast at the English Embassy was most interesting.
I began by refusing on account of my mourning,
but Lord Lyons wrote me a nice note saying that
there would be no one but the L&eacute;on Says and Mr. and
Mrs. Gladstone, so I accepted. I was very anxious to
see Mr. Gladstone.</p>

<p>We had a pretty little breakfast upstairs in the small
dining-room, and the talk at table was most interesting.
I thought Mrs. Gladstone looked older than her
husband. He of course did most of the talking. He
has a fine voice, bright, keen, dark eyes, holds himself
very erect, and apparently knows everything about
everything. When the men were smoking after breakfast
I had quite a talk with Mrs. Gladstone, who told
me about the murder of Lord Frederick Cavendish.
She said her husband heard it at a big London party,
and had to go and tell Lady Frederick. Mr. Gladstone
was more upset by the whole thing (and the having to
tell the unfortunate wife) than she had ever seen him.
Il y avait de quoi, for even here in Paris, where <em>outside</em>
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_4" title="pg 4"> </a>
questions don't trouble them very much, there was great
excitement when the news came.</p>

<p>I had a nice talk with Plunkett, who congratulated me
on W.'s<sup><a href="#fn1" id="r1">[1]</a></sup> appointment as Ambassador to Vienna. I told
him there was no truth in the report (they had offered
it to W., but he won't hear of it), and I think he is quite
right. He has no particular <em>attaches</em> at Vienna. He
knows German well, but doesn't speak it absolutely perfectly,
and hasn't really the social talents that one needs
in Vienna. They ought to send a dashing general, or a
courtier, not a serious savant.</p>

<p>We certainly are leading different lives. I am wrapped
in my fur coat, and driving in a shut carriage. Your
tea in the garden sends a shiver through me. It sounds
quite romantic having the son of the "Roi des Montagnes"
to breakfast. I wonder if I shall ever see
Athens; W. says when I do that I will never care again
for Rome; that colouring and ruins are far superior in
Greece. I almost think in that case I would rather remain
under my present impression of dear, beautiful
Rome, not quite like our American friend, who thought
"the Colosseum was pretty, but she liked the Court-House
at St. Louis better."</p>


<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Paris</span>,<br >
Sunday, March 18, 1883.<br ></p>


<p>I will write a little this morning, Dear&mdash;I am just back
from l'&Eacute;toile. I have had rather an agitated week, and
here is my news, good&mdash;bad&mdash;I don't know myself. W.
is going as Ambassador Extraordinary to Moscow to
represent France at the Coronation of the Emperor Alexander.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_5" title="pg 5"> </a>
It was a "bolt from the blue" to us. I will tell
you from the beginning. We went to ride as usual
Thursday morning, but rather earlier than usual (9.30).
When we came home Mdme. Hubert told us we hadn't
been gone ten minutes, when le Ministre des Affaires
&Eacute;trang&egrave;res (Challemel-Lacour) came to see W., was
much discomposed at not finding him, and told Mdme.
H. he would come back at 11. He didn't reappear, but
one of the young attach&eacute;s did, with a note from Challemel
begging W. to come and see him directly after
breakfast. We couldn't think what he wanted, but we
both made up our minds it was to insist on the Vienna
Embassy. I protested, and I think W. would not have
taken it.</p>

<p>I went out in the afternoon with Anne to try on a dress
at Redfern's, and just as we were coming away W. appeared.
He had seen the carriage at the door and knew
he would find us. He looked rather preoccupied, so I
said, "You are not surely going to Vienna?"</p>

<p>"No, not to Vienna, probably to Russia, for the Coronation."</p>

<p>I was too bewildered at first to take it in, and I must
frankly say I was wretched. Of course he asked 24
hours to think it over, though the Minister urged him
very much to accept at once. Challemel also wishes me
to go, says a woman gives more &eacute;clat to an Embassy.
Of course it will be a magnificent sight, but I am a perfect
poltroon&mdash;I am so afraid they will take advantage
of that crowd to blow up everybody. However, if that
should happen it would be better to be blown up together,
but I really am nervous (I am not usually such a
coward, but Russian Nihilists and dynamiters are terrible
elements to contend with), and wish they hadn't asked
him to go.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_6" title="pg 6"> </a></p>

<p>Of course it is a great honour and compliment to W.'s
personal position, and I have given no opinion, but I
don't feel happy at all. I have always said that I would
never try to influence my husband's actions (public) in
any way, and I suppose I have kept to that as well as
most women do who marry public men, but I should like
to put a decided veto now. I will keep you au courant of
the decision.</p>

<p class="author">March 20th.</p>

<p>Well, Dear, it is quite decided. W. accepts to go to
Moscow, and takes me with him. He consulted his
brother and his friends and all told him he could not refuse.
As long as they didn't send a soldier (W. himself
would have asked Mar&eacute;chal MacMahon to go, if he had
been at the Foreign Office), he was "tout indiqu&eacute;."
<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">[2]</a></sup> It
seems all the other Powers are going to send Princes&mdash;Spain,
the Duc de Montpensier; England, the Duke of
Edinburgh; Italy, the Duc d'Aoste, etc.</p>

<p>We are to start somewhere about the 8th or 10th of
May. W. is busy now composing his Mission. Of course
everybody wants to go. It seems such an undertaking.
We had a nice ride this morning&mdash;various people riding
with us, and all talking about the Coronation. I overheard
one timid old gentleman saying to W., "Vous emmenez
votre femme? Vous avez tort; on ne sait pas ce
qui peut arriver"&mdash;not very reassuring.</p>

<p class="author">April 1st.</p>

<p>My Dear, my letters will now become monotonous,
as I have only one idea&mdash;the Mission. All the arrangements
are being made, such an affair. W. has sent off
a man to Moscow to see about a house big enough to
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_7" title="pg 7"> </a>
hold all the party, with ballroom, and large dining-room
We are 9 people&mdash;W. and I; Comte de Pont&eacute;coulant,
Ministre Pl&eacute;nipotentiaire (W.'s ancien Chef de Cabinet);
G&eacute;n&eacute;ral Pitti&eacute; (G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Division, chef de la maison
militaire du Pr&eacute;sident de la R&eacute;publique); Colonel
Comte de Sesmaisons, commandant les 6&egrave;me hussards;
Fran&ccedil;ois de Corcelle, Secr&eacute;taire d'Ambassade;
Commandant Fayet (de la maison du Pr&eacute;sident&mdash;Jules
Gr&eacute;vy); Richard Waddington, D&eacute;put&eacute;, Capitaine
dans l'arm&eacute;e territoriale; Robert Calmon, lieutenant
dans l'arm&eacute;e territoriale. L'uniforme est absolument
n&eacute;cessaire en Russie.</p>

<p>We have three servants&mdash;W.'s valet Joseph and my
two maids Adela&iuml;de and Mdme. Hubert. All the gentlemen
have their servants. Then there is Pierson, the
huissier from the Quai d'Orsay (you know whom I mean,
the big man who wears a gilt chain, announces the people,
and writes down names, etc.), two cooks with one or
two gar&ccedil;ons de cuisine; 3 coachmen, Hubert of course,
and two Englishmen. One, Mr. Leroy, such a magnificent
person, came this morning to see W. He has already
repr&eacute;sent&eacute; on several occasions, and driven gala
carriages, etc. He seems graciously inclined to go with
us (with very high wages, and making his conditions&mdash;will
drive only the Ambassador and Ambassadress in the
gala carriage, etc.). That will necessitate very delicate
negotiations with Hubert, who also wishes to drive only
the Ambassador and me. However, as he has never
driven a gala carriage, and they are very heavy, unwieldy
vehicles to manage, I think he must waive his claim.</p>

<p class="author">April 10th.</p>

<p>There has also been a long consultation about horses,
how many for the gala carriage. When Mar&eacute;chal MacMahon
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_8" title="pg 8"> </a>
went as Ambassador Extraordinary to the Emperor
of Germany's Coronation he had six horses and
running footmen (it seems there must be six or two&mdash;four
are not allowed. Four would be too sporting&mdash;not
serious enough). We have four enormous footmen,
and one ordinary sized one for every-day use&mdash;2 gala
carriages, and a coup&eacute; d'Orsay, which must be painted
dark blue with white stripes, our colours.</p>

<p class="author">April 12th.</p>

<p>We are getting on slowly. The horse question is
settled&mdash;no one has more than two, so we take 9
enormous carrossiers. Hawes is commissioned to get
them. They could not be found anywhere in France.
I forget the exact height (as big as they make them),
but he promises to get them from England, or the
Luxembourg, where it seems they have a special breed
of enormous, heavy coach horses.</p>

<p>We had a most satisfactory interview this morning
with M. Lhermite, the head man of the great restaurant,
Potel &amp; Chabot. W. had been rather bothered about
a head man, or major domo, who could take charge of
the whole household. Our Joseph is not very brilliant&mdash;he
does W.'s service, and can look after an ordinary
household, but would not be at all up to the mark in
this case. Lhermite heard that W. was looking for
someone, so he came and volunteered to go with us,
and superintend everything. He was so well dressed
and had such good manners that W. rather demurred,
and thought he was above the place; however Lhermite
pressed it very much, and wound up by saying, "J'ai
&eacute;t&eacute; cuisinier moi-m&ecirc;me, Monsieur, personne ne vous
servira mieux que moi." So it was settled, and he has
full powers to engage cooks, scullions, etc.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_9" title="pg 9"> </a></p>

<p>The man who went to Moscow has just sent us the
plan of the house which he has found. It seems large
and handsome, a good entrance, marble staircase, large
ballroom and dining-room, and sufficient bedrooms. It
calls itself "Maison Klein," not a palace; and is evidently
the house of a rich Jew.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, May 6th.</p>

<p>I am glad to have a day of rest, Dear. I didn't even
get up for church. The standing at the dressmaker's
is something awful. Yesterday I tried 12 dresses
(finished), 6 at Delannoy's before breakfast, and 6 at
Philippe's afterwards. They are all handsome&mdash;I think
the Court dresses will be handsome. The principal one
for the day of the Coronation is sapphire blue satin
embroidered all round the train (3 m&egrave;tres long), with a
beautiful wreath of flowers in chenille, and silk, and gold
and silver leaves; very showy, in fact rather clinquant
(not at all like me), but they said I must have "des toilettes
&agrave; effet qui seraient remarqu&eacute;es." The under-dress
is salmon pink satin, the front all covered with flowers
to match the embroidery. I shall wear blue feathers
(short ones) in my hair. I am happy to say that the
regulation white waving plumes of the English Court
are not de rigueur in Russia. The other train is a pale
pink satin with raised dark red flowers and velvet leaves,
all the front my old point de Venise flounces which look
handsome. I suppose I shall take about 18 dresses in all.</p>

<p>I have just had a nice visit from Prince Orloff, Russian
Ambassador here, who is a great friend of ours, and who
was very anxious from the first that I should go. I
confided to him that I was very nervous and uncomfortable.
I don't mind so much in the day time when I
am seeing quantities of people, and interested in the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_10" title="pg 10"> </a>
preparations; but I don't sleep, and have visions of the
Kremlin being blown up, and all sorts of horrors. As
Richard<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">[3]</a></sup>
goes with us too, I have made W. appoint a
guardian for Francis, as Henrietta and Anne could hardly
bring up a Frenchman, and after all we may none of us
ever come back.</p>

<p>Henrietta was reduced to tears this morning when W.
gave her the key of his secr&eacute;taire, and said his will and
last directions were there, in case anything happened to
him&mdash;cheerful preparations for a festive journey.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, May 8, 1883.</p>

<p>Our boxes and cases are being packed, and the house
is a curiosity&mdash;crowded with every conceivable thing.
My two maids (I take Mdme. Hubert too, as Adela&iuml;de is
not very strong, and if she gave out I should be in a bad
way) are much taken up with their outfit. They each
have two sets of new things, a blue serge costume and
coat for travelling, and a black silk for their gala
occasions. Pont&eacute;coulant is always teasing Mdme. Hubert,
and asking if "ses toilettes sont pr&ecirc;tes."</p>

<p>This morning I saw the 9 gigantic horses which were
paraded under the windows. They started to-night, as
they must rest at Berlin. M. Lhermite is a treasure.
He also starts to-night with his cooks and provisions of
all kinds. W. and Pont&eacute;coulant gave him all their instructions,
and then he came for mine. I told him I
must have my maids in the room next to me, and as we
had a plan of the house, it is quite easy. I have a fair-sized
bedroom and dressing-room (which he will arrange
as a sort of boudoir) on the court (no living rooms are
on the street), and the maids a large room opening out
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_11" title="pg 11"> </a>
of the dressing-room. He is eminently practical; takes
charge of the whole personnel, will arrange a sort of
dormitory for all the men servants; will see that they are
ready in time, clean and well turned out.</p>

<p>Pont&eacute;coulant, who is also very practical, overlooks
that part of the business; also the stables, and Mr. Leroy
and Lhermite will report to him every morning. Leroy
has also just been in, much pleased with his gala carriage
and liveries. Hubert is beaming, and most particular
about his lace jabot and ruffles. I wonder how they will
all ever settle down to our quiet life again.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, 10th.</p>

<p>I will finish this afternoon, Dear. I am ready to start,
dressed in my travelling dress, dark blue cloth, with a
long coat lined with red satin, and a black hat with blue
feathers (I haven't got on the coat and hat yet). There
has been such a procession of people all day, and great
vans to carry off the luggage. I have been rather
bothered about my jewels&mdash;how to carry them. I have
taken everything the family own. Anne's necklace, with
some extra stones I had, has been converted into a tiara.
All the Russian women wear their National coiffure at
the Coronation, the Kakoshnik. As that is very high,
studded with jewels, any ordinary arrangement of stars
and feathers would look insignificant. Freddy, who is
an authority on such matters, advised me to concentrate
all my efforts on the tiara&mdash;he also suggested ropes of
pearls (artificial) but I couldn't make up my mind to
that. Chemin, the jeweller, was very anxious I should
"louer" a sort of breastplate of diamonds&mdash;but on the
whole I preferred taking less&mdash;merely mine and the
sisters'. What I shall do if they are stolen or lost I am
sure I don't know. I don't care to carry them myself
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_12" title="pg 12"> </a>
in a bag, as I never by any chance carry my bag, I
should certainly leave it somewhere; and I don't like
to give it to the maids either, so I have put all the jewels
in two trunks, scattered about the fond, wrapped up with
silk stockings, etc.</p>

<p>I have given my last instructions to Nounou, and a
nice young coachman who comes to replace Hubert in
our absence, and also provided a surprise for baby in the
shape of a large train, which will distract him the first
days. We saw also this morning the detective who goes
with us. He is one of those who always accompany the
foreign Princes who pass through Paris, and is said to
know well all the great nihilist leaders (all of whom he
says will be at the Coronation). He has two ordinary
policemen with him. They go of course on the
train with us, and never lose sight of us. I shall feel
rather like a distinguished criminal being tracked across
Europe.</p>

<p>Pont&eacute;coulant is very funny over Philippe the coiffeur,
who presented himself at the Quai d'Orsay, and insisted
upon being included in the suite (consequently travelling
free of expense on the special trains, etc., with us). He
really isn't my coiffeur&mdash;I never have anyone except
Georges from time to time, but I daresay I shall be glad
to have him. He said to Pont&eacute;coulant, "Monsieur le
Comte comprend bien qu'il faut que je pose le diad&egrave;me
de Madame l'Ambassadrice le jour du Couronnement;"
however he has gained his point, and Madame l'Ambassadrice
takes her own coiffeur with her, as well as her
two maids.</p>

<p>Well, Dear, we are going in an hour, and I must try
and reason with myself, and not be the arrant coward I
really feel like.</p>

<h3><em>To G. K. S.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Kaiserhof, Berlin</span>,<br >
Saturday, May 12th, 1883.</p>

<p>Here we are, having accomplished our journey so far
most comfortably. We arrived last night about 9, and
this morning I am unpacking a little, and settling myself,
as we shall stay four or five days. Our departure from
the Gare du Nord Thursday night was a curiosity. We
got rather early to the station, as W. was preoccupied
with the baggage, and besides there were last words to
say to all the people who came to see us off. Henrietta,
rather tearful, came with us to the station&mdash;Francis was
so engrossed with his new railway train that was careering
round on beautiful green rails in his father's study,
that he was quite indifferent. The whole quai was filled
with boxes and trunks labelled "Waddington, Moscow,"
and when you think that all the soldiers took their saddles
and trappings of all kinds, and what the stable alone
represented, 2 enormous gala carriages, one coup&eacute;
d'Orsay, and all the heavy harness and servants' liveries,
you can imagine what an excitement there was until
everything was put on board.</p>

<p>We started, however, fairly punctually&mdash;W. and I had
a lit-salon, with cabinet de toilette; the two maids and
W.'s man next door, and Sesmaisons and Fran&ccedil;ois de
Corcelle (the only two who came with us, the rest of
the Mission joins us Tuesday at Berlin), had their coup&eacute;
next to ours. There were all sorts of last directions to
be given to Pont&eacute;coulant, and to poor Henrietta, who
remains in charge of Francis.</p>

<p>I slept pretty well all night, as you know I am a good
traveller, and about 7 Adela&iuml;de came in to arrange me
a little, as we were to breakfast at Cologne (where we
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_14" title="pg 14"> </a>
were due at 8 o'clock) with our consul there, and also
the consul at D&uuml;sseldorf, who is rather a friend of W.'s.
We had a very good little breakfast in the private room,
and when we started again, the Chef-de-Gare coming at
the last moment to conduct us to our coup&eacute;, there was
much bowing and scraping to Monsieur l'Ambassadeur
and Mdme. l'Ambassadrice. We made quite an excitement
at the station, and all the people who were coming
and going in the numerous trains that passed through
had their heads out of the windows to see what was
going on. They had filled our coup&eacute; with papers of all
kinds (German), illustrated and political, also a large
bouquet for me.</p>

<p>We dined at Hanover, not in a private room this time,
but at a round table at one end of the large room. Who
do you think came to see me? Mr. Joy; he had seen in
the papers that we were to pass through, so he took
himself down to the station to see if he could see us.
I introduced him to W.&mdash;we had only time for a little
talk, as he came rather late. He also brought papers
and a magazine or two, so we are well supplied with
literature for the present.</p>

<p>When we arrived here at the station we found M. de
Courcel, our Ambassador in Berlin, waiting for us with
all his staff. He drove us at once in his carriage to the
hotel, and said he would come in again an hour later
and tell W. about his audiences, etc. We have beautiful
rooms, a large salon looking on the street, dining-room,
two good-sized bedrooms and a very good ante-room
(where by the way Pierson, with his chain and sword
and dress clothes, is already installed. When I came out
of the salon just now he was there, and I rather felt as
if I was back at the Quai d'Orsay, and he was announcing
my visitors).</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_15" title="pg 15"> </a></p>

<p>While we were talking to Courcel last night one of
the hotel servants came in to say&mdash;would I go for one
moment to speak to the maids, he couldn't make out
what they wanted. I did go, but merely to tell these
ladies that I would thank them to get along as well as
they could, and to find a polygot waiter, or someone to
translate for them; that I certainly was not going to
look out for them, and they had better try and learn a
little German.</p>

<p>Courcel says the Emperor, Prince Imperial, and Bismarck
all want to see W.&mdash;he also warns him that
Bismarck is in an execrable humor. I don't think W.
minds that very much. He is a very cool gentleman
himself, and I imagine he will say all he wants to to the
great man.</p>

<p class="author">10-30.</p>

<p>W. and I went for a walk before breakfast to the
Pariser Platz to see the outside of the French Embassy;
it looks big and imposing. We came home through
"Unter den Linden." Berlin has much improved, and
has much more the air of a capital than when I first saw
it a great many years ago. Of course I was much struck
with the quantities of soldiers one sees in the streets.
The officers are a fine lot of men, but, like ramrods,
so stiff; and when they are walking two or three together
take up the whole pavement.</p>

<p>Sesmaisons and Corcelle breakfasted with us&mdash;Sesmaisons
is delighted to be back in Berlin. He was military
attach&eacute; there at the time of the Berlin Congress,
when St. Vallier was Ambassador, and has many friends.
M. de Courcel came in just as we were finishing, with
a long list for W., his audience cards, invitations, etc.
Then came George de Bunsen with his wife and daughters.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_16" title="pg 16"> </a>
I had never seen the ladies of the family, and
was glad to make their acquaintance. They were very
friendly, and we made various engagements with them.
M. de Bunsen I had seen before in France&mdash;he is quite
charming, very good-looking, and not at all Prussian, so
cosmopolitan, which is always most attractive.</p>

<p>W. and I went out together and paid several visits, to
the Embassy first, where we found Mdme. de Courcel.
The rooms are large and handsome, with good pictures
and splendid tapestries. We took a turn in the Thiergarten,
and the Jardin Zo&ouml;logique (where we saw an
enormous yellow lion&mdash;a terrible beast, handsome, too).
W. then went to see Hatzfeldt (Foreign Minister), who
was very amiable, but said nothing in particular&mdash;none
of Bismarck's people ever do.</p>

<p>We dined early at the Embassy with all the personnel.
The dinner was good and handsome, plenty of
servants, lights, flowers&mdash;everything in very good style.
While the men were smoking Mdme. de Courcel and I
talked. She told me some of her Berlin experiences,
and how difficult her beginnings were, but I suppose
they always must be until one has had time to look
around a little. We have just come home, and after
talking a little with the gentlemen I have left them to
their cigars and papers, and am glad to be in my own
quarters.</p>

<p>The maids have had a delightful afternoon. They
have found a g&eacute;rant who speaks French, and who has
taken them a little about Berlin, which they find "tr&egrave;s
gentil." W. has his audience from the Emperor at one
o'clock to-morrow in uniform. None of the ladies, Empress
nor Princesses, are here, so I have nothing to do.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_17" title="pg 17"> </a></p>

<p class="author">Sunday, May 13th.</p>

<p>I didn't go out this morning, but wrote and read.
The two gentlemen breakfasted with us as usual, and a
little before one W. went off for his audience with the
Emperor in full uniform, which is very becoming to him.
(He hates it as it is so heavy, with all the thick gold
embroidery, and he is very hot and uncomfortable.)
The audience lasted about three-quarters of an hour.
W. was astounded at the Emperor's appearance and conversation,
said he was au courant of everything&mdash;he said
among other things&mdash;"Ah, vous emmenez Mme. Waddington
&agrave; Moscow? eh bien! moi, je n'envoie pas mon
h&eacute;ritier," adding though immediately he didn't think
there was any danger from the Nihilists this time.</p>

<p>He had barely time to get home and out of his uniform
when Lord and Lady Ampthill arrived. They were
quite charming, both of them. He and I plunged into
the old Roman days, where we knew him so well as
Odo Russell. They are great favourites here, both at
court and with their colleagues. He spoke a great deal
about St. Vallier, said he was the best colleague he had
ever had.</p>

<p>At four W. started again to see Bismarck (not in uniform
this time), and I drove out to the George Bunsens'
to have tea. They have a pretty house. Theodore
was also there, and we had a pleasant hour. They asked
us to come in to-morrow after our dinner at the Embassy.
When I got back I found W. smoking in a big
arm-chair, quite pleased with his talk with Bismarck,
who was most amiable, had at least no "crise de nerfs"
while he was there. He said he was very frank, almost
brutal, in his appreciations of other countries, and particularly
of different public men whose views didn't coincide
directly with his, but on the whole not too offensive.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_18" title="pg 18"> </a>
He kept him until his dinner was announced (at
5 o'clock), and asked him to come and see him on his
way back from Moscow, and give him his impressions;
so apparently it is only from his own agents that he
doesn't wish impressions. Do you remember C. writing
to him, from the Hague, I think, the account of some
manifestation or political crisis, and naturally saying what
he thought about the matter; and the very curt answer
he received from the Minister, saying he had asked for
facts, and not for "personal appreciations." One would
think that the opinion of the most ordinary agent on
the spot would have a certain importance.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, 15th.</p>

<p>It is very warm&mdash;I have been out with Adela&iuml;de trying
to get a light blouse, my cloth body is unbearable.
Everything was shut yesterday, as it was Whit Monday.
W. dined at the Palace at 5, Sesmaisons also. I went to
the races with Mdme. de Courcel and some of the young
men. It was rather amusing, a lovely day, about three
quarters of an hour by train from Berlin. The public
was not nearly so &eacute;l&eacute;gant as on a Paris race-course, but
there were more pretty women, and quantities of stiff,
arrogant officers (always en tenue).</p>

<p>When we got back to the hotel at 7.30 we found W.
at the door, just back from his dinner, so Fran&ccedil;ois de
Corcelle and I dined t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, and W. talked to us&mdash;said
the dinner was good, small and easy. The Prince
Imperial and Grand Duchess of Baden were both there.
The Grand Duchess told W. that in a telegram received
that morning from her mother (the Empress Augusta)
she had said how much she regretted not seeing him,
that she had always watched his career with great interest,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_19" title="pg 19"> </a>
and was very glad to see him coming to the front
again.</p>

<p>The Emperor talked about everything&mdash;France; England;
the religious question in France; he believed French
women of all classes were clerical, and under the influence
of the priests, so naturally they could have no
sympathy with a liberal government, "which is a pity, it
is a mistake to have the women against you." We had
an audience with the Prince Imperial after dinner, which
was pleasant, but absolutely commonplace. He and all
the Princes were in uniform, petite tenue.</p>

<p>We finished our evening at the Bunsens', which was
pleasant. W. was very glad to have a quiet talk with
M. de Bunsen, who is most attractive, such a charming
manner. This evening we have dined as usual at the
French Embassy with quite a party, including Bleichroeder,
an Israelite banker, bras droit of Bismarck, and
therefore interesting. We came early, as all the rest of
our Mission arrived to-night at 9 o'clock, and we wanted
to see them. They all came up after supper, looking
most cheerful, had had a very pleasant journey, rather
warm in the middle of the day, and were quite game
to see all they can of Berlin to-morrow, as we go on to
Warsaw to-morrow night.</p>

<p class="author">Wednesday, May 16th.</p>

<p>We are starting this evening, Dear, so I will scratch a
few lines to finish this very long epistle, and will send it
from here. It is still very warm. I went out to see
some of the pictures (how beautiful the Velasquez are)
and the marbles of Pergamos, and Pont&eacute;coulant and I
breakfasted together at the hotel; W. and Richard at the
George Bunsens', who really have been as friendly and
hospitable as possible. After breakfast we had various
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_20" title="pg 20"> </a>
visits, and then Pont&eacute;coulant, Corcelle and I went for a
last drive in the Thier-Garten. I hoped we should meet
either the Emperor (I have never seen him) or the Prince
Imperial, but we didn't. There were plenty of people
riding and driving, as it was the fashionable day "Corso."
We saw the Princess Frederick Charles in an open carriage
with four horses, and a piqueur in front. The Court
liveries are handsome, but sombre, black and silver.
Everybody bowed and curtseyed, the officers saluting
de front.</p>

<p>We went round by the Zoo to show Pont&eacute;coulant the
big lion. Pont&eacute;coulant was most amusing over their
journey, and said he was nearly driven out of his mind
the day before they started with all the people who came
to see him. He says Philippe, the coiffeur, has never left
him, that it won't be his fault if my diadem is not perfectly
pos&eacute;, and that he plied him with beer all along the
route. He is here supping and living at the hotel with
all our suite, and sent word to me this morning that
he was at my disposition to make me a "coiffure de circonstance"
for the night journey. What do you suppose
it would have been?</p>

<p>Pont&eacute;coulant had seen Henrietta and Francis the day
he left, and had left orders at the Foreign Office that the
Havas telegrams which will keep her au courant of our
movements shall always be sent to her. All the personnel
except W. and me dine at the Embassy to-night.
I am not sorry to have a quiet evening. We leave at
11 to-night, and get to Alexandrownow about 7.30 to-morrow.
That is the Russian frontier, and there we
shall have some sort of official reception.</p>

<p>W. has been riding these last two days with Sancy,
the military attach&eacute;, and that always does him good.
I couldn't find any sort of silk blouse, so I trust it won't
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_21" title="pg 21"> </a>
be very warm travelling to-night. When we cross the
frontier I shall feel as if our journey had begun. Here
we have lived so with the Embassy that I hardly feel as
if I was abroad, only the cadre is different, and the
Prussian uniforms a disagreeable reminder. I don't
think it is an easy post to be Ambassador here, and I
should think M. de Courcel's succession would be a very
difficult one. He knows German well, and has always
lived with diplomatists, but if they send a political
man, I think he will have a hard time; though as Bismarck
said to W. when they were talking about any
possible war in Europe&mdash;"Je d&eacute;sire la paix, je suis un
homme satisfait," which wasn't very pleasant for the
French Ambassador to hear, as I suppose what has
largely contributed to his satisfaction is the possession
of Alsace-Lorraine.</p>

<p>We have had our dinner, and W. smoked on the balcony,
and we saw all the gentleman-servants, omnibuses
and baggage start. We shall only go just in time to
have 5 minutes talk on the platform with M. de Courcel,
who is coming to say good-by. The g&eacute;rant of the hotel
has just been up to hope we were satisfied&mdash;would we
telegraph when we came back, as of course he would
give us the same rooms, and presented me with a large
bouquet.</p>

<p>Did I say that the Malagache Embassy was at the
hotel, on the same floor with us. Every time I go down
the corridor I see two or three tall, dark men, dressed
in white flowing garments and white turbans, who make
me low salaams. They are not going to the "Kronung,"
as they call it here.</p>

<p>My next letter will be from Warsaw, where we should
arrive at 4 to-morrow afternoon.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe, Varsovie</span>,<br >
Thursday, May 17th, 1883.</p>

<p>Here we are, Dear, having arrived from Berlin at 3.30
this afternoon. We started at 11&mdash;it was very hot even
at that hour of the night, and the coup&eacute;-lit stuffy and
uncomfortable. M. de Courcel and all his staff were at
the station to see us off, and the two Embassies united
made quite a gathering. I had a little talk with Princess
Guillaume Radziwill, who is starting for the Coronation.
It seems she has splendid jewels, and was rather bothered
to know how to carry them. She has got them all on,
in little leather bags around her waist, and she thinks
she won't be very comfortable all night, with pins,
brooches, etc., running into her. She was horrified when
I told her where mine were.</p>

<p>The night was long, we were not very comfortable,
and the gentlemen were decidedly squeezed in one little
carriage. We stopped somewhere, I don't remember
the name, about 6. The men all got out and had coffee.
I didn't move, but they sent me in a cup. We got to
Alexandrownow, the Russian frontier, about 8. The
station had a decidedly festive appearance&mdash;flags, greens,
soldiers, music, etc. They were evidently preparing a
salute and a national anthem of some kind. We all
thought it was for us, and were proceeding to emerge to
the strains of the "Marseillaise," when we heard the
"Wacht-am-Rhein." It seems there was a Hessian
Prince, nephew of the Emperor, on board, who was also
going to the Coronation, so we rentr&eacute;ed our heads, and
remained quietly in our carriages until they had disposed
of him.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_23" title="pg 23"> </a></p>

<p>Then came our turn. We were received with all
ceremony&mdash;a tall Russian officer took charge of me, saying,
in very good French, he was sure I would like to
brush off the dust, and have some tea, etc. He took me
upstairs to a very nice room, where a little maid was
waiting with hot water, towels, brushes, tea, and little
rolls. I took off my dress to have it brushed, and while
I was standing in my petticoats several gentlemen came
to the door (which wouldn't shut), and made various perfectly
unintelligible remarks to me. The little maid
laughed and made signs, and carried off my dress, which
I thought was dangerous&mdash;however I couldn't say anything,
so I put myself behind the door, and Adelaide
arranged my hair; and I was just thinking of having a
cup of tea when the maid reappeared with my dress,
accompanied by another officer, who told me in French,
from the other side of the door, that his Royal Highness
of Hesse hoped I would do him the honour of
breakfasting with him. I said I would come with <ins title="Transcriber note: spelled 'pleassure' in image">pleasure</ins>,
but begged they wouldn't wait, as I was not quite
ready. As soon as I was dressed I sallied out, found
my officer waiting, who conducted me to a private room,
where were the Prince and his party, including W. and a
Russian general, who had been sent from Varsovie to
meet the Hessian Prince.</p>

<p>They were all at table&mdash;the Prince put me next to him,
introduced the Russian general and all his suite, and we
had rather a pleasant hour. We had excellent tea in
glasses (the first time I ever saw it), delicious little rolls,
eggs, and cold meat. The Prince is a tall, broad-shouldered,
good-natured German, speaking French quite well.</p>

<p>We had the same ceremony at starting, first the
"Wacht-am-Rhein" for the Germans, then the "Marseillaise"
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_24" title="pg 24"> </a>
for us. The journey was not particularly interesting
from the frontier here, but Varsovie itself most
curious. We found the same bustle and preparation at
the station here&mdash;the Governor of Varsovie, and Pr&eacute;fet
de Police en tenue, and our Consul, M. B&eacute;rard.</p>

<p>We drove at once to the hotel, looked at our rooms,
which are comfortable, and started again for a little drive
through the town before dinner. Anything so unlike
the cities one has been accustomed to see can't be imagined,
long, straggling streets, enormous spaces, many
houses tumbling down, and abominable pavement, deep
holes, and paving stones as big as ordinary rocks&mdash;why
the carriage ever got along was a mystery to us all.
The Russian coachman, a perfect type with his long
caftan and flat cap. Why the horses remain attached
to the carriage is a problem, as they apparently have no
harness of any description. I used to think we didn't
use much in America. Will you ever forget Coligny's
face at Oyster Bay when we started trotting down hill
without any breeching?</p>

<p>There were quantities of dirty Polish Jews in every
direction, all with their long caftans, greasy, black curls,
and ear-rings. I had time to rest a little before dinner.
We all dined together, also B&eacute;rard the Consul, all the
men in their dress clothes, and I in my grey moir&eacute; with
white lace, and a big, black velvet bow, one string of
pearls which I had on under my corsage. Pont&eacute;coulant,
who is the next man to W., took me in, and I had General
Pitti&eacute; on the other side. The dinner was handsome and
well served. Pont&eacute;coulant had attended to that while
we were driving about.</p>

<p>After dinner the men all went off to the theatre in the
Governor's box to see a famous ballet. I was rather
tired, and as we start again to-morrow, and have two
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_25" title="pg 25"> </a>
nights in the train, I sha'n't mind going to bed early. I
was interrupted, as we have had a visit, pleasant enough,
from Mavrocordato (Greek), who is also on his way to
Moscow to represent his country, and now I am going to
bed. We leave to-morrow at 4, and I will try and write
a little en route. They say I can probably, as the
Russian roads (railroads) are smooth, and they go very
slowly.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, 2 o'clock.</p>

<p>I will go on a little and send this letter also from here.
We had an expedition this morning to one of the
ch&acirc;teaux belonging to some member of the Sobieski
family, or rather belonging to a Potocki quelconque,
where there are many souvenirs of Sobieski. I never was
on such a villainous pavement (they tell me Moscow is
worse), and the road long and straight through flat
country, not very interesting. The ch&acirc;teau was full of
pictures and bibelots of all kinds, and every possible souvenir
of Sobieski, flags, swords, snuff-boxes, etc., and
quite worth seeing. I enjoyed the outing, as everything
was absolutely unique, carriages, costumes, carts, people,
language, houses, a poor tumble-down little hovel next
to a great palace with gates and courts and gardens.</p>

<p>We lunched again with all the Embassy, and then I
went to see what was happening to the maids. I had
left them in such a dejected condition on the landing
when I went out. They couldn't get hold of any servant
(couldn't make them understand when they did),
couldn't get my boots or travelling skirt, or hot water,
or anything, in fact. The hotel is full of people, all
starting this afternoon, and there is a fine confusion, but
they really must learn to get along without all modern
conveniences.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Entre Varsovie et Moscou</span>,<br >
en wagon, Samedi soir, 19.</p>

<p>I will try and write a little, Dear, while we are stopping
at Smolensk for tea. It is rather difficult when we
are moving (though we go slowly) as you will see by the
writing, as the train shakes a great deal. As soon as it
stops we all tumble out, are received by railway officials
in uniform, and conveyed to a private room decorated
with greens and flags, where most elaborate repasts are
provided. We got off from Varsovie yesterday most
comfortably about 4 o'clock. Various officials, our Consul
B&eacute;rard, were at the station to see us off, and an
engineer of the company, who goes with us to Moscow
to interpret and look after us generally. The train is
most luxurious&mdash;for W. and me one long saloon carriage
lined with grey satin, and with every variety of
easy chair, sofa, table, writing-table, lamp, etc. Flowers
on one of the tables and maps of the route on another.
Communicating with it and directly behind are
two bedrooms for us&mdash;mine is capitonn&eacute; in blue satin,
a very good-sized bed, glass, chairs, table, etc., also a
dressing-room with every modern convenience. W.'s is
grey satin, equally comfortable, with dressing-room, bath,
etc.&mdash;behind these again a coup&eacute; for the maids&mdash;then a
long carriage for the rest of the Mission with chairs,
tables, etc, and small coup&eacute;s. The engineer showed us
all the arrangements, hoped we were satisfied, and also
told us that two employ&eacute;s would be stationed at each
end of our carriage always for whatever we might want.</p>

<p>We got off fairly punctually. I wonder if I shall ever
see Varsovie again. We stopped somewhere about
5.30, and found a charming little tea waiting for us in a
private room, served of course in glasses with pieces of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_27" title="pg 27"> </a>
lemon, and excellent rolls and cakes. There we fraternized
with the Dutch Mission, who are also on the
train. M. Schimmelpenninck, a tall, stylish-looking man,
with his son and gendre. The young men had recognized
W., having seen him at the Congr&egrave;s de Berlin; so
they recalled themselves, and we made friends. We
agreed to take all our meals together, and as apparently
we shall have about 6 in the day we shall probably see a
good deal of each other.</p>

<p>We had rather a pleasant evening, dined (very well)
at Brest, always the same ceremonial; and after dinner
some of the gentlemen came and paid us visits. We
talked of course about "La Grande Arm&eacute;e" and Napoleon's
campaigns, as we are passing over the same ground
that they followed. The two moujiks at the doors are
most attentive and intelligent; as soon as they hear any
noise in our carriage, opening or shutting a window, or
anything falling (some of the heavy books slipped off a
table just now), they seem to divine it, and appear instantly
and ask, I suppose, what we want. We have no
means of communication, but they evidently understand.</p>

<p>I was very comfortable last night in my little blue
room, and had been sleeping quietly, when I seemed to
divine that someone had come in. I didn't stir, and
half opened my eyes, and for a moment was rather
startled. The lamp, shaded, was burning, and in came
one of the moujiks quite quietly. He moved very
softly about the room, rather an appalling figure, with
his high boots, fur cap, and curious half-savage face
(gentle too), touched door and windows, fussed over the
lamp, drew the curtain of the dressing-room a little
closer to keep out any draught (didn't come up to the
bed), and went out again just as quietly. It was a
curious experience, flying through the darkness of the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_28" title="pg 28"> </a>
night, and wakening to see that strange figure prowling
about.</p>

<p>About 7, I think, in the morning he reappeared, this
time standing at the door, and making many perfectly
unintelligible remarks. It was so evident I didn't understand
that he smiled, made a despairing gesture with his
hand, and disappeared. As I was quite sure he would
come back I got up and fastened the door. In a few
moments I heard a colloquy outside, and then the voice
of the engineer asking when I would like my maid and
my tea&mdash;also saying they would stop in about an hour
for early breakfast, and that mine and the Ambassador's
would be brought to our carriage.</p>

<p>I asked to have the maid at once&mdash;so Adela&iuml;de appeared
with hot water and a cup of tea, and I dressed
as comfortably as if I was in my dressing-room at the
Rue Dumont d'Urville. As soon as I was ready I went
into the big carriage, which looked very nice and clean,
had been swept and dusted, window-panes washed (Adela&iuml;de
saw the men doing it); a very nice little breakfast
tray was brought, tea, every variety of good little
rolls, and some fish. We contented ourselves with the
rolls, didn't experiment upon the fish. The table was
close to the window&mdash;all the gentlemen came up and
talked to us, and as usual there were quantities of people
about.</p>

<p>We have passed through most desolate country, miles
of plains, with scarcely any traces of human habitation.
The cottages are very few and far between&mdash;generally a
collection of
<ins title="Trancriber note: spelled 'litttle' in image">little</ins> wood hovels, or "isbas," as they are
called. We go long distances without seeing houses,
fences, gates, or even a road. At all the stations there
are people&mdash;the big ones crowded&mdash;and at the smaller
ones, where we hardly stop, merely slacken, peasants&mdash;and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_29" title="pg 29"> </a>
such objects, one can hardly tell the men from the
women; long, unkempt hair, all barefooted, and all wearing
a sort of fur garment with a hole in the middle to pass
the head through, and which falls low down to their
knees.</p>

<p>We have just had tea at Smolensk, which is very
Russian looking, with gilded domes and pink and green
painted roofs. The gentlemen are smoking and walking
up and down the platform, always exciting great attention.
There are two rather pretty girls, with fair hair
and red blouses, who are giggling and looking, and evidently
wish to be remarked.</p>

<p>We have gone on again now and are settled for the
evening. The carriage looks so comfortable, curtains
drawn, lamps lighted, flowers on the tables, and quantities
of books and maps. Sesmaisons and Corcelle have
just been in with their maps and Napoleon's Memoirs.
It is most interesting to follow it all. They read out bits
here and there as we passed through some well-known
locality. At the Beresina, I think, where the passage of
the river was so awful&mdash;some of the men quite exhausted,
and yet not wanting to lie down on the snow, made themselves
seats out of the dead bodies of their comrades.
What an awful retreat!</p>

<p>We have crossed the Beresina, where we saw a long
procession of wood rafts. They are of the most primitive
description&mdash;long logs lashed together, and in the
middle a sort of cabin or hovel, where the women and
children live. They were floating slowly down with the
tide as we passed, and singing a sort of sad, monotonous
chaunt, which sounded weird and pathetic, but impressionnant.
They say all the Russian National songs have
that undercurrent of sadness.</p>

<p>Our dinner to-night was very gay. Schimmelpenninck
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_30" title="pg 30"> </a>
is most attractive. We have become great friends&mdash;I
have even confided to him where my jewels are, as he
thought I had left a bag in one of the stations, and
was convinced it held my diamonds. I told him what
dress I was going to wear at the Coronation, also my
difficulty in finding out what the French Court dress
was. The Empress never wore a regular Court train&mdash;her
presentations in the Tuileries were always in the
evening, in ordinary ball dress. I didn't think Queen
Marie Am&eacute;lie's would have been very pretty, so we
concocted a Court dress from pictures, other people's
souvenirs, etc.</p>

<p>I was glad to walk up and down a little&mdash;one gets
cramped sitting so long, even with our outings for food,
which are frequent. The tea is extremely good always,
a sort of greenish flavour, but very delicate, and I should
think very strong. Pont&eacute;coulant showed me Monsieur
Philippe in the distance, talking and gesticulating, evidently
considering himself a most important feature of
the Mission&mdash;also the detective, who looks like an amiable
well-to-do bourgeois travelling for his pleasure, until
you meet his eyes, and there is a quick, keen look which
tells you he is very much on the alert. He has again
just given W. the pleasing piece of information that all
the well-known Nihilist leaders will be at Moscow.</p>

<p>Hubert came up and says the horses are quite well&mdash;their
rest at Berlin did them good. He is very much
impressed with the absolute solitude of the country&mdash;"pas
de villages&mdash;pas de barri&egrave;res, pas m&ecirc;me de chemins."
We have also a telegram from M. Lhermite saying
the house is quite in order, he and his cooks and attendants
installed, and he will have breakfast ready for us to-morrow
morning. We arrive about 8. We must be ready
early, as they say the approach to Moscow is very fine.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_31" title="pg 31"> </a>
It stands low in a plain, but one sees the gilt domes and
coloured steeples from a great distance.</p>

<p>Our engineer tells us the railway officials are out of
their minds. He says the special envoys&mdash;Princes particularly&mdash;change
their minds and their routes all the
time. They all have special trains, and the confusion
will be something awful. The Hessian Prince is just
ahead of us. We haven't crossed many trains, and yet
there must be frequent communication between Varsovie
and Moscow.</p>

<p>I still feel rather in a dream, but not tired. I must
stop now as it is nearly eleven&mdash;my next letter will be
from Maison Klein, Malaia Dimitrofska, Moscow. Richard
came in just now, and we have been talking over our
future&mdash;Russia is a "terra incognita" to all of us. It has
been certainly most novel and interesting so far. Just
now we stopped for a few moments at a little station,
quite alive with people and lights, as of course trains
are going all night. The people look so different&mdash;generally
fair, with flat features, and a repressed look, as
if they had always been kept down.</p>

<p>This long effusion will go early to-morrow morning,
as they send off a valise at once from Moscow.</p>

Monday, May 21st, 1883.</p>

<p>We arrived quite safely and comfortably yesterday
morning&mdash;34 people, counting servants, policemen, etc.
I hadn't time to write, but you will have had the Havas
telegram announcing our arrival. I am writing in my
little boudoir, which looks on a large, square, light courtyard,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_32" title="pg 32"> </a>
and I wish you could see the wild confusion that
reigns there. Quantities of boxes and "ballots" of every
description. Mdme. Hubert, with a veil tied over her
head, struggling to get at some of my trunks, which are
all marked with an enormous M. K. W. in white letters
(a private mark, so as not to confound them with the
general mark of the Mission). Leroy, Hubert, and
Pont&eacute;coulant trying to get the big carriage cases opened
(they look like small houses). Sesmaisons and Calmon
fussing over their saddles, which they apparently had got
without much difficulty&mdash;quantities of Russian helpers
working, talking, but <em>not</em> loud, nor yelling to each other.
How anything will ever come out of all that chaos I don't
know.</p>

<p>However, I must begin at the beginning. We got
here about 8.30 yesterday morning. We were all up
early, as the country grew more interesting as we approached
Moscow. We had a confused vision of gilt
domes, high coloured steeples, etc., but nothing stood
out very distinctly. There was a fine confusion at the station&mdash;quantities
of officials, all in uniform, detachments
of soldiers, red carpets, etc. We were <em>not</em> received
officially, not being Princes. The Mission only exists
here <em>after</em> they have presented their lettres de cr&eacute;ance.
We found our consul, Lagren&eacute;, waiting for us, several
members of the French Colony, and Lhermite. We
drove off at once to our Ambassade. The main street,
Tverskaya, looked very gay with quantities of flags and
draperies in every direction, and even at that time in the
morning a great many people. Our house looks well&mdash;the
entrance isn't bad, and the staircase marble, handsome.
I hardly looked at the reception-rooms, as I was
anxious to get to mine. Lhermite had done them very
well, quite as I wanted, and a nice-looking woman,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_33" title="pg 33"> </a>
Russian of course, the femme de charge left in the house,
was there to see if everything was right.</p>

<p>I washed off a little dust, got a cup of tea, and then
went with W. and Pont&eacute;coulant to inspect the house.
The ballroom, "serre," and 3 drawing-rooms are nice;
the dining-room small in comparison and low. Not a
breath of air anywhere, double windows, hermetically
sealed, with <em>one</em> pane opening in each; so the very first
thing we did was to send for someone to take down the
extra window, and open everything wide&mdash;the close
smell was something awful. The femme de charge was
astounded, and most unwilling. I think she thought we
wished to demolish the whole establishment. W. has a
large room opening out of the drawing-room. Pont&eacute;coulant
took charge of the distribution of the gentlemen's
rooms (which wasn't easy, as they were generally
small, and not particularly comfortable, but I must say
they were all easy going, and not at all inclined to make
difficulties). He chose a room down-stairs for himself
next the Chancellerie, which he has arranged at once
very well. The ballroom is handsome, a parquet floor,
and yellow satin furniture; the other drawing-rooms too
are well furnished in silk and satin. The dining-room is
small, but the serre will make a very good fumoir where
the gentlemen can sit and smoke. It has nice cane arm-chairs
and tables, and will be a resource.</p>

<p>I went back to my own rooms and arranged my
affairs with the maids. There is a large room, half
lingerie, half d&eacute;barras, upstairs, with good placards and
closets where I can put my dresses if I ever get hold of
them. They must be unpacked at once, particularly the
velvet dresses. Of course I am always at the window.
My Dear, how it would amuse you, so absolutely unlike
anything you have ever seen.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_34" title="pg 34"> </a></p>

<p>The men seem to work well enough&mdash;they all wear
red <ins title="Transcriber note: spelled 'flannnel' in image">flannel</ins> shirts tucked into their trousers, and high
boots&mdash;at the present moment they are all gaping at
the horses, who certainly do look enormous (the
Russian horses are all small). It seems ours stand the
cannon, and shouting, and waving flags and draperies
very well (so the lessons in the &Eacute;cole Militaire, where
they were taken several times after they arrived in Paris
to have cannons and guns fired close to their heads, and
flags waved about, did them good).</p>

<p>A little Russian maid, in a red petticoat, and a blue
handkerchief tied over her head, has just appeared, and
I suppose will be a sort of fille de chambre. She smiles
every time I speak to the maids, and watches every
movement I make. I moved a fauteuil just now, and in
an instant she had possession of it, and stood over it
looking at me hard to see where I wanted it put. I
daresay we shall get on very well. We breakfasted at
12.30 all together&mdash;a very good breakfast, flowers on
the table, and everything most correct. The gentlemen
were amusing, all giving their experiences. Just as we
were finishing we heard someone coming, with the clank
of sabre, and those long, heavy spurs the Russians wear;
and a good-looking officer, Colonel Benckendorff, who
was attached to our Embassy, appeared. He will never
lose sight of us now until the ceremonies are over.</p>

<p>We adjourned to the serre, and he put us au courant
of everything. He told us the crowd and confusion at
the Kremlin was indescribable (all the foreign Princes
are lodged there). He had all sorts of papers, invitations,
audiences, cartes de circulation, etc. W. is to
present his lettres de cr&eacute;ance and all the Mission en
grande tenue at 10.30 to-day. (I am waiting now to
see them start.) W. has just been in, looking very well,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_35" title="pg 35"> </a>
as he always does in full uniform. He wears the Danish
Grand Cordon, he hasn't the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur nor any
Russian decoration. Two Ma&icirc;tres des C&eacute;r&eacute;monies, covered
with gold lace and embroideries, have arrived in
an ordinary Russian Court coup&eacute;&mdash;they have also an
Imperial gala carriage for the Ambassador, and two ordinary
Court carriages, and they have just started, quite
a crowd of people before the house to see them depart.
First went two Ma&icirc;tres des C&eacute;r&eacute;monies, their coats covered
with gold embroidery; then W. alone in a gala carriage
with four horses, two footmen standing behind, two
mounted, and an &eacute;cuyer. The rest of the Mission followed
in two ordinary Court carriages, all with the Imperial
liveries, which are not very handsome, long red
cloaks, with a sort of cocked hat. Benckendorff followed
alone in his private carriage.</p>

<p>Our big footmen figured for the first time&mdash;the four
in their blue and silver livery were at the door when
the Ma&icirc;tres des C&eacute;r&eacute;monies arrived, and Pierson with his
chain in the anteroom. They looked very well; Lhermite
and our coachman saw the whole thing, and were
not at all impressed with carriages, liveries, or horses.
They said the carriages were absolutely shabby, the
liveries neither well made nor well put on, and the horses
beneath criticism. They do look extraordinarily small
before those great heavy state carriages, rather like rats,
as Hubert says&mdash;"Quand on verra les n&ocirc;tres ce sera une
surprise," for they are enormous.</p>

<p>What do you think I did as soon as they had all gone?
I had rather an inspiration&mdash;I told the maids to bring
me my blue court train (they have unpacked some of
the boxes, the jewels are all right, and locked up in a
coffre-fort in W.'s room, but can't find one of Delannoy's
caisses; I suppose it will turn up though, as
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_36" title="pg 36"> </a>
Pont&eacute;coulant says the compte was quite right when we
arrived yesterday, all the boxes here). I then locked the
door of the ballroom, stationed Pierson outside, with
strict orders not to let anyone in, put on my train over
my brown cloth dress, put Adela&iuml;de and Mdme. Hubert
at one end of the room, and whisked backwards and
forwards, making them low curtseys (they were rather
embarrassed). I have never worn a train in my life, as
you know, and I wanted to see how it would go. It
seems perfectly cut, and follows every movement, and
doesn't get twisted around my ankles. The maids were
quite satisfied, and told me it worked beautifully, particularly
when I backed across the room. Madame
Jaur&egrave;s, wife of Admiral Jaur&egrave;s, permanent French Ambassador
to Russia, told me such hideous tales yesterday,
when she came to see me, of women getting
nervous and entangled in their trains when they backed
away from the Emperor, that I thought I had better
take some precautions. I indulged in those antics for
about twenty minutes, then unlocked the door, released
Pierson, and went upstairs to the lingerie to see how
my unpacking was getting on. The missing trunk had
just arrived, and my two women, with the little Russian
maid, whose eyes opened wide when she saw the
quantity of dresses being produced, and W.'s man were
putting things to rights.</p>

<p>The gentlemen got back to a late breakfast, much
pleased with their reception. They were received in a
small palace outside of Moscow,<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4">[4]</a></sup> as the Emperor makes
his formal entr&eacute;e into the town to-morrow only. They
found the Emperor very amiable, talking quite easily,
saying something to everyone. He had on the Grand
Cordon of the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur. They were all presented
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_37" title="pg 37"> </a>
also to the Empress. W. said she was very
gracious and charming; remembered quite well having
seen us in Paris. We were presented to her by the
Prince of Wales, Exhibition year. He said she recalled
the Princess of Wales, not so tall, and had splendid eyes.</p>

<p>Benckendorff stayed to breakfast, and we told him
his place would be always ready for him at breakfast
and dinner. The hours of standing apparently will be
something awful. About 3.30 Mdme. Jaur&egrave;s came for
me, and we went to see Lady Thornton, who is Doyenne
of the Corps Diplomatique, but didn't find her.
The Jaur&egrave;s have just arrived themselves with all the
Corps Diplomatique from Petersburg. They said the
starting from there was frightfully mismanaged, not
nearly carriages enough for the people and their luggage.
The Ambassadors furious, railway officials distracted,
a second train had to be prepared which made
a long delay, and a general uproar. The only man who
was quite quiet and happy was Mr. Mackay (Silver King
from California). He formed part of the United States
Mission, had his own private car attached to the train,
in which were Mrs. Mackay and Mr. and Mrs. Hunt
(U. S. Minister and his wife), and was absolutely independent.</p>

<p>After leaving our cards we drove through the
Tverskaya, the main street. There were quantities of
people, and vehicles of every description, from the Ambassadors'
carriages (all with small, black Russian horses,
a Russian coachman in caftan and flat cap, and a gorgeous
chasseur, all gold braid, and hat with feathers,
beside him), to the most ordinary little drosky or fiacre.
Nigra, the Italian Ambassador, passed us going very
quickly with the regular Russian attelage&mdash;3 horses, one
scarcely harnessed, galloping almost free on one side.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_38" title="pg 38"> </a></p>

<p>All the houses are dressed with red and gold draperies,
and immense tribunes put up all along the
street, as the procession passes through it from one end
to the other when the Emperor makes his formal entrance
to-morrow. There are crowds of peasants and
country people, all the men in flannel shirts tucked into
their trousers, and the women with a handkerchief or
little shawl over their heads. They don't look the least
gay, or excited, or enthusiastic; on the contrary, it is
generally a sad face, principally fair, and blue eyes.
They stand, apparently a compact mass, in the middle
of the street, close up to the carriages, which can
scarcely get on&mdash;then comes a little detachment of
Cossacks (most curious looking, quite wild, on very
small horses, and enormous long lances), rides into the
crowd and over them. They make no resistance, don't
say anything, and close up again, as soon as the carriage
passes&mdash;and so it goes on all day.</p>

<p>I was quite excited when we drove into the Kremlin&mdash;it
is enormous, really a city, surrounded by a great
crenellated wall, with high towers at intervals, quantities
of squares, courts, churches, palaces, barracks, terraces,
etc. The view of the town from one of the terraces
overlooking the river is splendid, but the great interest
is the Kremlin itself. Numbers of gilt domes, pink and
green roofs, and steeples. It seemed to me that pink
predominated, or was it merely the rose flush of the
sunset which gave a beautiful colour to everything. We
saw of course the great bell, and the tower of Ivan the
Terrible (from where they told us he surveyed massacres
of hundreds of his soldiers), everywhere a hurrying, busy
crowd (though always quiet).</p>

<p>Thanks to our "Carte de Circulation" we pass everywhere,
though stopped at every moment. We crossed,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_39" title="pg 39"> </a>
among other things, a procession of servants, and minor
court officials, with quantities of silver dishes, flagons,
etc., some great swell's dinner being sent from the Imperial
Palace. We went from one great square to another,
stopping at the Palace where all the f&ecirc;tes are to
be. There we found one or two Court officials whom
Mdme. Jaur&egrave;s knew, and they showed us as much as
they could, but everybody is "sur les dents," and nothing
ready; and in spite of all the precautions one feels that
there is a strong undercurrent of nervousness. We
went to the Church de l'Assomption, where the Coronation
is to take place. There too we found officials,
who showed us our places, and exactly where the Court
would be. The church is small, with a great deal of
gilding and painting. All the tribunes are ready, and
what we shall feel like when the ceremony is over I
am sure I don't know. It will last about three hours
and a half, and we stand all the time. There is not a
vestige of a seat in the Tribune Diplomatique&mdash;merely
a sort of rail or "barre d'appui" where one can lean back
a little.</p>

<p>We lingered a little on the terrace overlooking the
river where there is a fine view of the town, and came
out by the Porte St. Sauveur, where everyone, Emperor
and peasant, uncovers. I was glad to get home
and rest a little before dinner, but I have had a delightful
afternoon.</p>

<p>I will finish this evening, as the bag goes to-morrow.
We had a pleasant dinner, our personnel only, and
Colonel Benckendorff, who told us all we had to do
these days. The day of the Coronation we meet at the
German Embassy (General Schweinitz, who married
Anna Jay, is Doyen of the Corps Diplomatique), and
go all together to the Kremlin. The hour of rendezvous
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_40" title="pg 40"> </a>
is 8 there, and as it is quite far off, and the gala
carriages go on a walk, we must leave here at 7, and
get up at Heaven knows what hour. What do you
think we will look like in full Court dress at that hour
in the morning? Our dinner was very good&mdash;wines,
fruit, etc. W. complimented Lhermite.</p>

<p>To-morrow we start at 11 for the Palace of Prince
Dolgourouky, Governor of Moscow, from where we see
the Emperor pass on his way to the Kremlin. It is
not far away, but the streets are so barricaded and shut
up that we must make a long d&eacute;tour. The most stringent
measures are taken, all windows closed, no canes
nor umbrellas allowed, and a triple line of troops all
along the route. The maids are much excited. They
have places in one of the Tribunes, and M. Lhermite is
going to escort them. In some marvellous way they
have been able to communicate with the Russian maids,
and have given me various pieces of information. I
have left the gentlemen all smoking in the serre, except
W., who retired to his own quarters, as he had some
despatches to write. He has had a long talk with
Jaur&egrave;s this afternoon, and has also seen Sir Edward
Thornton, British Ambassador. The house is quite
quiet&mdash;the court-yard asleep, as no carriages or horses
have been out to-night. We have two ordinary Russian
landaus, with those fast little horses, for our every-day
outings, as the big coup&eacute; d'Orsay only goes out on
state occasions.</p>

<p>The detective has made his report, and says the Nihilists
will do nothing to-morrow&mdash;<em>perhaps</em> the night of
the gala at the Op&eacute;ra. It is curious to live in such a
highly charged atmosphere, and yet I am less nervous&mdash;I
wonder why&mdash;the excitement I suppose of the whole
thing. Well, Good-night, Dear; I would say it in
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_41" title="pg 41"> </a>
Russian if I could, but so far all I have learnt is "Tchai,"
which means tea, and "Karosch," which seems to be
an exclamation of delighted admiration. The little
maid says it every time I appear in a new garment.</p>

Mardi, May 22d, 1883.</p>

<p>How shall I ever begin to describe to you, Dear, the
wonderful life we are leading. Everything is unlike anything
I have ever seen. I suppose it is the beginning
of the real far-off East. This morning I am sitting at
the window reading and writing, and looking out into
the court-yard, which is a never-failing interest&mdash;such
quantities of people always there. The first thing I
hear in the morning is Pont&eacute;coulant's voice. He is
there every day at eight o'clock, conferring with Leroy
and Hubert, examining the horses and carriages, deciding
which ones are to be used, and giving orders for the
day.</p>

<p>Then arrive the two Russian landaus which go all
day, and very different they look from our beautiful
equipages and big important servants. Then comes
Lhermite, rattling off, in a low pony cart, with the boy
from the Consulate along-side of him. He goes to
market every day, and nearly has a fit because he can't
talk himself, and he knows they are all lying, and stealing,
and imposing upon him generally. In one corner
there is a group of little Russian horses tied to the stable
doors, with Russian soldiers fussing over them. They
have been sent from one of the cavalry barracks for the
gentlemen to ride.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_42" title="pg 42"> </a></p>

<p>In every direction men are cleaning carriages, saddles,
harness, liveries; and with such little noise&mdash;they are
extraordinarily quiet.</p>

<p class="author">May 22d, 5.30.</p>

<p>We have just got back from the Governor's palace;
and to-night the Emperor is safe in the Kremlin.</p>

<p>It was a marvellous day. We started (the whole
Mission) at 10.30 this morning, W. and I alone in the
d'Orsay, which looked very handsome. It is dark blue
with white stripes, like all our carriages, and lined with
blue satin of rather a lighter shade. The men were
in demi-gala, blue plush breeches, white silk stockings,
and high hats (not tricornes), with silver bands and
cords. Thornton, the English coachman, looked very
smart, and handled his big black horses perfectly. The
gentlemen told us he used very strong language when
he got back to the stables over the abomination of the
Moscow pavement. We were preceded as usual by
Richard and Benckendorff in a light carriage. I wore
one of Philippe's dresses, brown gauze embroidered in
velvet flowers, all the front &eacute;cru lace, and an ecru straw
bonnet, with a vieux rose velvet crown.</p>

<p>I was much amused while I was dressing to hear various
members of the party in the lingerie, "Madame,
voulez-vous me coudre un bouton," "les plumes de mon
chapeau ne tiennent pas," etc., even Thornton came in
to have his lace cravate tied. We were a long time getting
to Prince Dolgourouky's palace; not that it is far
away, but the streets are barricaded in every direction,
however I didn't mind&mdash;the crowd was so interesting,
packed tight; they had been standing for hours, they
told us, such pale, patient faces, but so <em>un</em>joyous; no
jokes, nor bits of songs, nor good-natured scuffling; so
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_43" title="pg 43"> </a>
unlike our Paris crowd on a great f&ecirc;te day, laughing and
chaffing, and commenting freely on everything; and
certainly very much unlike the American-Irish crowd
at home in New York, on the 4th of July or St. Patrick's
day. I remember quite well putting boxes of fire-crackers
in a tin pail to frighten the horses, and throwing
numerous little petards under people's feet, but no
one seemed to mind. Fancy the effect of a pailful of
fire-crackers exploding in any part of Moscow to-day.
The tribunes covered with red cloth, or red and gold,
crammed; and armies of soldiers, mounted and on foot,
in every direction; and yet we were only in the side
streets. The real crowd was in the Tverskaya where
the cort&eacute;ge was to pass.</p>

<p>When we finally arrived we were received by the
Governor's two nieces, Madame Mansouroff and Princess
Obolenski. The Prince, like all the other Russian
noblemen, took part in the cort&eacute;ge. All our colleagues
were there, but the Duc de Montpensier was
the only special envoy. All the other foreign Princes
were riding with the Emperor's suite. It was almost a
female gathering, though of course all the men of the
Corps Diplomatique were there. We waited some little
time in the large drawing-room, where many presentations
were made; and then had a very handsome breakfast,
people talking easily, but the Russians visibly
nervous and preoccupied. As soon as it was over we
went out on the balconies, where we remained until the
cort&eacute;ge had passed. They brought us tea at intervals,
but I never stirred from my chair until the end.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful sight as we looked down&mdash;as far
as one could see, right and left, flags, draperies, principally
red and gold, green wreaths, flowers and uniforms&mdash;the
crowd of people well kept back behind a
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_44" title="pg 44"> </a>
triple row of soldiers, the middle of the street perfectly
clear, always a distant sound of bells, trumpets, and
music. A salute of cannon was to let us know when
the Emperor left Petrofski, the small palace just outside
the walls where he has been all these days. As the time
drew near one felt the anxiety of the Russians, and
when the first coup sounded, all of them in the Palace
and in the street crossed themselves. As the procession
drew near the tension was intense. The Governor's Palace
is about half way between the gate by which the
Emperor entered and the Kremlin. He had all that
long street to follow at a foot's pace. As soon as he
entered the Kremlin another cannon would tell his
people he was safe inside.</p>

<p>At last the head of the gorgeous procession appeared.
It was magnificent, but I can't begin to tell you the
details. I don't even remember all I saw, but you will
read it all in the papers, as of course all their correspondents
are here. There were quantities of troops of
all descriptions, the splendid chevaliers-gardes looked
very imposing with their white tunics and silver cuirasses;
both horses and men enormous. What I liked
best were the red Cossacks (even their long lances red).
They look perfectly wild and uncivilized and their little
horses equally so, prancing and plunging all the time.</p>

<p>The most interesting thing to me was the deputations
from all the provinces of this vast Empire&mdash;Kirghis,
Moguls, Tartars, Kalmucks, etc. There was a magnificent
chief from the Caucase, all in white, with jewelled
sword and high cap (even from where we were, so high
above the crowd, we saw the flash of the diamonds);
the Khan of Khiva, and the Emir of Bokhara, both with
high fur caps, also with jewels on cap and belt. A young
fellow, cousin I think of Prince Dolgourouky, came
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_45" title="pg 45"> </a>
and stood near me, and told me as well as he could who
the most important people were. Bells going all the
time (and the Moscow bells have a deep, beautiful
sound), music, the steady tramp of soldiers, and the
curious, dull noise of a great crowd of people.</p>

<p>Then a break in the troops, and a long procession of
gala court carriages passed, with six horses and six runners,
a man to each horse, with all the grands-maitres
and high officials of the Court, each man covered with
gold lace and embroidery, and holding his staff of office,
white with a jewel at the top. After that more troops,
the Emperor's body-guard, and then the Emperor himself.
He was in full uniform, riding quite alone in front
on his little white horse which he had ridden in the Turkish
campaign. He looked quite composed and smiling,
not a trace of nervousness (perhaps a little pale), returned
all the salutations most graciously, and looked
up, bowed and smiled to our balcony. A little distance
behind him rode his two sons, and close up to him on
the left rode the Duke of Edinburgh in red; any bomb
thrown at the Emperor must have killed the English
Prince.</p>

<p>Then followed a long suite of Princes&mdash;some of their
uniforms, Austrian, Greek, and Montenegrian standing
out well. From that moment there was almost silence
on the balcony; as the Emperor disappeared again all
crossed themselves, and everyone waited for the welcome
sound from the Kremlin.</p>

<p>After a long interval, always troops passing, came the
Empress. She was with her daughter, the little Grand
Duchess Xenia, both in Russian dress. The carriage
was shut, a coup&eacute;, but half glass, so we saw them perfectly,
and the high head-dress (Kakoshnik) and white
veil, spangled with silver was very becoming. The carriage
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_46" title="pg 46"> </a>
was very handsome, all gold and paintings; six
white horses led, and running footmen. The Empress
and her daughter were seated side by side, and on a
curious sort of <em>outside</em> seat, on one side of the coup&eacute;,
was a page, dressed in red and yellow, a sort of cloth of
gold, with high feathers in his cap. The Empress looked
grave and very pale, but she smiled and bowed all the
time. It must have been an awful day for her, for she
was so far behind the Emperor, and such masses of
troops in between, that he might have been assassinated
easily, she knowing nothing of it.</p>

<p>There was again a great sound of bells and music when
the Empress passed, all the people crossing themselves,
but the great interest of course was far ahead with the
Emperor. A great procession of Court carriages followed
with all the Princesses, Grandes-Ma&icirc;tresses, etc.,
and endless troops still, but no one paid much attention;
every ear was strained to hear the first sound from the
Kremlin. When the cannon boomed out the effect was
indescribable. All the Russians embraced each other,
some with tears running down their cheeks, everybody
shook hands with everybody, and for a moment the emotion
was contagious&mdash;I felt rather a choke in my throat.
The extraordinary reaction showed what the tension had
been.</p>

<p>After rather a whirl of felicitations we went into the
drawing-room for a few minutes, had tea (of course), and
I talked to some of the people whom I had not seen before.
Montpensier came up, and was very civil and nice.
He is here as a Spanish Prince. He told me he had been
frightfully nervous for the Emperor. They all knew
that so many Nihilists were about&mdash;he added, "Il &eacute;tait
superbe, leur Empereur, si cr&acirc;ne!"</p>

<p>We had to wait a few moments for the carriage and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_47" title="pg 47"> </a>
got home about 5, having been standing a long time.
We were almost as long getting back to the Embassy as
we were coming. There was a dense crowd everywhere,
and the same little detachments of Cossacks galloping
hard into the midst of the people, and apparently doing
no harm to anyone.</p>

<p>I will finish now before going to bed&mdash;happily all our
dissipations finish early. We dined quietly with only
our own Embassy and Benckendorff, and then drove
about for an hour or so looking at the illuminations,
which were not very wonderful. We met all our colleagues
doing the same thing. W. has just had his report
from the detective. He said all the Nihilists were
scattered along the route to-day, but evidently had no
intention of doing anything. It seems curious they
should be allowed to remain, as of course the Russian
police know them quite as well as our man does.</p>

<p>I have just had a notice that the Empress will receive
me to-morrow. I will try and write a few lines always
late before going to bed, and while the whole thing is
still fresh in my memory. If this letter is slightly incoherent
it is because I have had so many interruptions.
The maids can hardly undress me, they are so anxious to
tell me all they have seen. It certainly was a magnificent
sight to-day, and the fears for the Emperor gave
such a dramatic note to the whole thing. My eyes are
rather tired, looking so hard, I suppose.</p>

<p class="author">Wednesday, May 23d.</p>

<p>Well, Dear, I have had my audience. It was most interesting.
I started at 11 o'clock in the gala carriage,
Hubert driving me, as he wanted to go once to the
Kremlin with the carriage before the day of the Coronation.
It seems there is a slight rise in the road just as
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_48" title="pg 48"> </a>
one gets to the gate, which is also narrow. I wore the
blue brocade with bunches of cherries, the front of
mouss&eacute; velvet, and a light blue cr&ecirc;pe bonnet, neither
gloves nor veil. Benckendorff and Richard, as "officer
de service," went ahead in a small carriage. Benckendorff
said I must have one of my own Embassy, and
Richard thought it would amuse him to come. W.
rather demurred&mdash;was afraid we wouldn't be serious
enough, but we promised him to be absolutely dignes.
Do you remember at the first official reception at the
Instruction Publique he never would let you and Pauline
stand behind me&mdash;he was afraid we would make unseemly
jokes, or laugh at some of the dresses.</p>

<p>Our progress to the Kremlin was slow. The carriage
is heavy, goes always at a foot's pace, and has a swinging
motion which is very disagreeable. I felt rather shy,
sitting up there alone, as of course there is a great deal
of glass, so that I was much "en &eacute;vidence." Everybody
looked, and the people in the street crowded close
up to the carriage. We found grand preparations when
we got to the Palace&mdash;the great staircase covered with
a red cloth, and every variety of chamberlain, page,
usher, and officer on the stairs and at the door. Benckendorff
and Richard helped me out of my carriage,
and Richard's impulse was to give me his arm to go
upstairs, but he was waved back imperatively, and a
magnificent gentleman in a velvet coat, all lace and embroidery,
advanced, and conducted me up the grand
staircase, always a little behind me. I passed through a
hedge of uniforms and costumes. When we came to
the landing where there was a piquet of soldiers my
attendant said&mdash;"La France," and they presented
arms.</p>

<p>At the top of the staircase, at the door of the first of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_49" title="pg 49"> </a>
a long enfilade of salons, I was handed over, with a very
low bow, from my first gentleman to another of the same
description, equally all gold lace, and embroidery; and
so I passed through all the rooms, always meeting a
new chamberlain in each one. The rooms are large and
high, with vaulted roofs like a cathedral, little or no
furniture (I believe the Russian Court never sits down
except at meals). We made a halt in one of the salons,
where we found several maids of honour of the Empress,
who were presented to me. They were all dressed much
alike in long, light dresses, and wore their badge&mdash;the
Empress's chiffre in diamonds on a blue ribbon. While
I was talking to them a procession of diplomats and
special envoys passed through the room. They had just
been received by the Empress.</p>

<p>Presently appeared Prince Galitzin&mdash;Grand Ma&icirc;tre
des C&eacute;r&eacute;monies, attired in red velvet and lace, and embroidery,
who said, "Sa Majest&eacute; sera bient&ocirc;t pr&ecirc;te." I
continued my progress with the same ceremonial, passed
through the salle du tr&ocirc;ne, which is handsome, white
and gold; and came to a standstill in the next salon, evidently
the ante-chamber of the room where I was to be
received, as the two colossal negroes who always accompany
the Emperor and Empress were standing at the
door. They were dressed in a sort of Asiatic costume,
cashmeres, turbans, scimitars, etc. I was received by the
Princess Kotchoubey and Count Pahlen, Arch Grand
Ma&icirc;tre des C&eacute;r&eacute;monies. The Princess K. is the mother
of Princess Lise Troubetzkoi (whom you will remember
in Paris as having a salon the first days of the Republic
where political men of all opinions assembled&mdash;Thiers
was her great friend). She was a little old lady, dressed
entirely in white, with a jewel low on her forehead.
Count Pahlen was dressed in blue velvet and embroidery,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_50" title="pg 50"> </a>
and carried his staff of office, white, with a large sapphire
on the top.</p>

<p>We talked a few minutes, when apparently there came
a signal from the Empress. The doors flew open, and
the Princess advanced to the threshold, making a
beautiful curtsey (I am sure mine was not half so good),
she seemed to go straight down to the ground, said&mdash;"J'ai
l'honneur d'annoncer l'Ambassadrice de France."
She then withdrew to one side&mdash;I made a curtsey at
the door, which was instantly shut, another, a little farther
on (the regulation is 3), but hadn't time for my
third, as the Empress, who was standing in the middle
of the room, advanced a few steps, shook hands and
begged me to sit down. I hadn't seen her for some
years, since she came to Paris with her husband, then
Grand Duke H&eacute;ritier (his father was still alive), and I
didn't find her changed. She recalls the Princess of
Wales, but is not so tall; has beautiful dark eyes, and a
very gracious manner. She was dressed almost as I
was, but in a different color, yellow brocade with
bunches of plums, splendid lace in front, and a beautiful
pearl necklace, three rows of large stones (my one row
of fairly large ones was nowhere). I think I stayed
about 20 minutes.</p>

<p>We talked easily enough. She said the long day yesterday
had been very fatiguing, the going at a foot's
pace all that long distance with the peculiar swinging
motion of the heavy gala carriage had tired her very
much; also the constant bowing right and left, and the
quantities of flags and draperies waving under her eyes.
She didn't say anything about being nervous, so of
course I didn't. She gave me the impression of having
extraordinary self-control. I asked her what the little
Grand Duchess thought of it all. She said that she
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_51" title="pg 51"> </a>
really didn't know&mdash;that she didn't speak, but looked at
everything and bowed to all the people exactly as she
did.</p>

<p>She said the day of the sacre would be very long and
tiring, particularly beginning so early in the morning;
that she was very matinale, quite accustomed to getting
up early&mdash;was I? "Fairly&mdash;but I hadn't often been up
and dressed in full dress and diamonds at seven in the
morning." "You would prefer a ceremony by candle-light."
"I think we should all look better at 9 o'clock
in the evening." She laughed, and then we talked a
little; Paris, chiffons, etc. She said some of her dresses
had come from Philippe. We talked a little about Moscow
and the Kremlin. She asked me what I had seen.
When I spoke of the church and the tribunes for the
Corps Diplomatique with <em>no</em> seats, and a very long
ceremony, she was quite indifferent; evidently didn't
think it was of the slightest consequence whether we
were tired or not; and I don't suppose it is.</p>

<p>When she cong&eacute;died me the door flew open (she evidently
had a bell under her chair which she touched with
her feet); she shook hands, and walked immediately to
a door at the other end of the room; so I didn't have to
back out all the way. Princess Kotchoubey and Count
Pahlen were waiting for me. The Princess said, "Sa
Majest&eacute; vous a gard&eacute; bien longtemps, Madame l'Ambassadrice.
J'esp&egrave;re que vous avez &eacute;t&eacute; contente." Pahlen
also made me a polite phrase. They both accompanied
me across the room, and then the door opened,
and another chamberlain took possession of me. Just
as we got to the door the Princess was saying something
about her daughter "devenue absolument une Parisienne,"
when it opened; she stopped short in the middle
of her phrase, and made me a little curtsey&mdash;her function
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_52" title="pg 52"> </a>
was over once I passed into the other room. It
was too funny.</p>

<p>I was conducted through all the rooms and down the
great staircase with the same ceremony. I found Richard
waiting in one of the big rooms, with the "Dames
du portrait," but this time he didn't venture to offer
his arm to the Ambassadress, and followed with Benckendorff
at a respectful distance.</p>

<p>I found my carriage surrounded by an admiring crowd.
The horses are handsome and enormous, particularly
here where the race is small, also the French gala liveries
are unlike anything else. Hubert, my own coachman,
sits up so straight and pompous on his box, and looks
so correct I hardly know him. The movement of the
gala carriage is something awful, makes me really ill.</p>

<p class="author">May 23d, 10 o'clock.</p>

<p>We have had a quiet evening&mdash;some of the gentlemen
have gone off to hear the famous Boh&eacute;miennes in
one of the public gardens. They have been leaving
cards all day on the special envoys, Princes, etc. W.
and Pont&eacute;coulant are having a conference, and I have
got into my tea-gown, and am reading a little, writing
a little, and being generally lazy. W. and I also did a
round of visits this afternoon.</p>

<p>As naturally none of our servants know either a word
of Russian, or the streets of Moscow, we took with us
the little polygot youth from the Consulate, who knows
equally well French, Russian, and German. We gave
him our list, and he went ahead in a drosky.</p>

<p>We found no one but the Princess Obolenski, who
spoke at once about the Emperor's entr&eacute;e; said no one
could imagine the relief it was to all of them to know
that he was actually safe in the Kremlin. They had evidently
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_53" title="pg 53"> </a>
all dreaded that day, and of course notwithstanding
all the precautions a bomb <em>could</em> have been thrown.
The thrower, par exemple, would have been torn to pieces
by the crowd; but what makes the strength of the Nihilists
is that they all count their lives as nothing in what
they consider the great cause.</p>

<p>How hideous the life of the Emperor and the Empress
must be. They say they find letters on their tables, in
their carriages, coming from no one knows where, telling
them of all the horrors in store for them and their
children.</p>

Thursday, 24 Mai, 1883.</p>

<p>I am having a quiet morning. We have no particular
function to-day. Madame Jaur&egrave;s is coming to get
me after breakfast, and we are going to do a little sightseeing.
The first thing I hear in the morning always is
Pont&eacute;coulant's voice in the court talking to Leroy and
Hubert, and examining the horses. The pair we had
in the gala carriage yesterday went beautifully. Hubert
was rather nervous, as there is a steep little bit
just as one passes through the gates of the Kremlin&mdash;it
is also narrow, and those big, unwieldy carriages are
not easily handled. The pavement is so rough that I
was actually a little sick yesterday after I came in.</p>

<p>I was called off by a visit from Prince Orloff (Russian
Ambassador in France). He comes almost every day,
and is much interested in all our doings&mdash;said the carriage
and general style of everything was much admired
yesterday. About two Madame Jaur&egrave;s came, and we
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_54" title="pg 54"> </a>
started off sight-seeing. The admiral, Jaur&egrave;s, and one or
two of the young men met us at the Kremlin, and we
went over the two palaces&mdash;new and old. The old one
is most curious; small, dark, low rooms, vaulted ceilings,
all most elaborately ornamented in Byzantine style; a
small steep, twisting staircase; large porcelain stoves, and
absolutely uncomfortable. We saw the dining-room
where the Emperor and Empress will dine in state the
day of the Coronation. The new palace is quite different&mdash;high,
light, large rooms, white, which must look
beautiful at night lighted by thousands of wax candles.
In the great ballroom the two Throne chairs are on
a gold dais with great curtains of purple velvet and ermine&mdash;very
royal looking.</p>

<p>(I wonder if the sight of all this splendour will destroy
my mental equilibrium&mdash;I assure you I felt rather like
a queen myself yesterday, seated up alone in the great
gala carriage, with everybody bowing and gaping.)
There is a splendid view over the Kremlin, the river and
the town from all the palace windows. We went again
to the church of the Assomption, where we found Count
Pahlen superintending. He showed us some of the
famous paintings&mdash;among others a Madonna with a
<em>black</em> face, a splendid diamond necklace, and large sapphires
and emeralds disposed about her person. There
are jewels about everywhere; on pictures, brackets, etc.
Pahlen told me, when I was noticing them, that the
Russian Court was famous for coloured stones, particularly
emeralds and sapphires&mdash;told me to notice the
Grand Duchess Constantine's emeralds, and the Empress's
sapphires. I will, if ever I get time to go into details,
but everything is on such an enormous scale here.</p>

<p>He also asked me if I was accustomed to <em>standing</em>
three or four hours, and if not he would suggest a <em>pliant</em>
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_55" title="pg 55"> </a>
"dissimul&eacute; sous les plis de la traine," and showed me
with pride the rails, covered with red velvet, in our tribune,
which he had had put there so we should be comfortable!
It will really be an awful day, particularly as
we have to begin it so early, but I suppose we shan't die
of it.</p>

<p>I came back about 4, changed my dress for something
more &eacute;legant (the blue silk with long blue redingote
and white lace), and started off again in the d'Orsay for
some visits (the little boy in the drosky going in front).
I found the Princess Radziwill in two small rooms (she
received me in her bedroom), all she could find for herself
and her husband in Moscow&mdash;and that at an awful
price (and she is Russian born). I also found Countess
Pahlen, wife of the Grand Master, who was very smiling,
and suggested that we should have an evening reception,
which would be much appreciated. Of course
we shall be delighted, and had even thought of a ball,
but all those things had been settled in Russia before we
left Paris. The Russian Court wished to have <em>one</em> ball
only, as the Coronation functions were numerous and
fatiguing, and that is to be at General Schweinitz's
(Doyen of the Corps Diplomatique).</p>

<p>After leaving Countess Pahlen I went again to the
Kremlin, the d'Orsay always exciting much attention.
I had the greatest difficulty in finding out the Duchesse
d'Edimbourg, for whom I had to write myself down, and
could find no servant who spoke either German, French,
or English. The crowd and confusion was something
awful; apparently the whole of Moscow was going
wherever I was&mdash;Ambassadors, Generals, Chamberlains,
maids-of-honour, servants with tea, crowding in all the
corridors. You never saw such a sight, and just as
many more in the court-yards&mdash;carriages, soldiers, work-people,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_56" title="pg 56"> </a>
carpenters, bales of stuffs, and planks for stands,
and all in that beautiful cadre&mdash;the old gray walls looked
so soft, and the marvellous effects of colour everywhere.
I was well shaken up, such a pavement. I met the Duc
de Montpensier at every turn, sight-seeing too. We
had a quiet dinner, the personnel only with Benckendorff.
The gentlemen had been going all around too
all the afternoon leaving cards. They all say the pavement
is most trying.</p>

<p>W. and Pont&eacute;coulant have come in late as usual for a
last little talk. I told them what Countess Pahlen had
said about an evening reception. W. had had the same
idea. I think the house is large enough&mdash;the ballroom
ought to light well, all white with yellow satin furniture.
We must have a talk with Lhermite about flowers; he
says there are none here, his come from Paris.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, 25th.</p>

<p>The men of the Embassy went off early, as they had
no end of audiences with all the Grand Dukes; uncles
and brothers of the Emperor. I walked about a little
with Adela&iuml;de, but I didn't find that very pleasant. It
is curious I never see a lady of any kind walking, and
we always attract attention. It is very warm, the sun
really powerful. I breakfasted alone in the big dining-room,
an elaborate meal, one ma&icirc;tre d'h&ocirc;tel and two
tall footmen waiting upon me&mdash;I was rather sorry I
hadn't asked for tea and cold chicken in my dressing-room.</p>

<p>At 3.30 the gentlemen all reappeared, put on their
Austrian decorations, and we started for the reception
of the Arch Duke and Arch Duchess Albert of
Austria. We found quantities of people, as all the Corps
Diplomatique had been convoked. W. and I went as
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_57" title="pg 57"> </a>
usual in the d'Orsay. I wore my cr&egrave;me voile with
lace and embroidery, straw bonnet with cr&egrave;me feathers,
lined with dark blue velvet. We waited some little time
in a large hall or anteroom where was Count Wolkenstein,
Austrian Ambassador, who presented all the suite
of the Arch Duke. Then appeared the Arch Duke
alone&mdash;said his wife was coming in a few moments. We
had known him in Paris&mdash;he had dined with us at the
Quai d'Orsay when W. was Foreign Minister, our Exhibition
year. He is a tall, distinguished looking man. It
was when he was dining at the Elys&eacute;e one night with
Mar&eacute;chal MacMahon that such a funny contre-temps
occurred. Their dinners were always very good and
soign&eacute;s, but evidently they had not thought about the
names of the dishes, and when we were well on with the
dinner we suddenly realized that something was wrong.
My neighbour said to me "Look at your menu," and
what did I see&mdash;"Glace &agrave; la Magenta"&mdash;"Gateau Solf&eacute;rino,"
and I forget the third thing&mdash;all battles where the
Austrians had been beaten. I spoke to one of the household
about it afterwards who said "J'ai froid dans le
dos en pensant &agrave; ce que le Mar&eacute;chal me dira." It seems
that when he was angry the Mar&eacute;chal didn't mince matters,
and used most <em>emphatic</em> expressions. You can imagine
how carefully we studied the menu of our dinner
which came two days after&mdash;"Glace &agrave; la R&eacute;gence,"
"G&acirc;teau Moka," etc., nothing compromising.</p>

<p>While the Arch Duke was talking there was suddenly
a move, and he went to meet the Arch Duchess
who came in, crossed the room quickly, and asked us
to follow. We did, into a smaller room, W. and I alone.
She is very handsome, younger than he is, tall and slight,
dressed in a black dress with a great deal of lace, a very
long train, a handsome pearl necklace, and a high comb
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_58" title="pg 58"> </a>
of diamonds. She said she would like to make a stay in
Paris. After they had cong&eacute;died us W. asked if he
might present the rest of the Mission, so I returned to
the large salon and saw various people to talk to, including
Count Apponyi, whom I had known in Paris, where
his father was Ambassador for years.</p>

<p>We dined at home and went in the evening to a reception
at M. de Giers'&mdash;Foreign Minister. The rooms
were not large, and there were a great many people,
I should think more foreigners and diplomatists than
Russians. Princess Kotchoubey and Countess Pahlen
did the honours. Quantities of people were presented
to me&mdash;I shall never remember their names or their
faces. I wore fraise-&eacute;cras&eacute; velvet, the front covered with
white "point &agrave; l'aiguille." General Wolseley, who is here
with the Duke of Edinburgh, was presented. He is not
at all the real British type, small and dark, but very bright
eyes. I also had quite a talk with my Dutch friend
Schimmelpenninck, who assured me my toilettes were tr&egrave;s
r&eacute;ussies, particularly the white one, this afternoon. I
had quite a talk too with the Hunts, who are very nice.
Both are tall and fine-looking, she always very well
dressed. The U.S. Mission is very distinguished&mdash;they
have Mr. and Mrs. Mackay with them, both very natural
and quiet; she of course has splendid jewels (they tell
me her sapphires are beautiful), but she wears them
quite simply, without any ostentation. There is also
Admiral Baldwin, who has his ship at Cronstadt, and two
charming young aides-de-camp, Rogers and Paul.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author">Saturday, May 26, 1883.</p>

<p>Well, Dear, I am just alive, but nothing more, having
performed 5 Grand Duchesses. The gentlemen all went
off in full uniform at 11 to begin their audiences. I followed
later alone (they always go en bande) with Richard
going in the small carriage in front as officier de service
(which amuses us both perfectly). I wore the white
soft silk with Valenciennes that you liked, and the flower
hat. Benckendorff complimented me on my toilette.
It was a long affair getting to our different Princesses.
They are all lodged in the Kremlin, and the various palaces
connect with all sorts of passages and staircases, but
the corridors are narrow and the block something awful.
My first audience was with the Grand Duchess Michel.
Her husband is an uncle of the Emperor, and was for a
long time Governor of the Caucasus. When we finally
got to the door of the apartments I was received by 2
Chamberlains (all gold and embroidery), who never left
me until they deposited me in the carriage at 5 o'clock&mdash;I
had started at 1.30. The ceremonial was always exactly
the same, one or two ladies-in-waiting were in the
room communicating with the one in which the Grand
Duchess was waiting. They announced "L'Ambassadrice
de France," I got through as many of my three regulation
curtseys as I could&mdash;I never really had time to
make the third, as they all advanced a few steps and
shook hands. The Grand Duchess Michel is a Baden
Princess, tall, slight, very intelligent, simply dressed in
black velvet, and of course a pearl necklace. She spoke
to me in English, French, and German, but the conversation
was mostly in French. She seemed well up in
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_60" title="pg 60"> </a>
French literature, and asked me what I thought of Zola's
"L'Assommoir," was really surprised when I said I
hadn't read it, nor in fact scarcely anything he wrote. She
considered it a marvel, and couldn't understand any
French woman not reading every word that came from
"un des plus puissants cerveaux du si&egrave;cle." She knew
too all the pieces de th&eacute;&acirc;tre, and when I expressed surprise
that she had had time to read so much, said her life
in the Caucasus was so lonely&mdash;no society of any kind,
and no resources outside of her own palace. I should
think she was a ma&iuml;tresse femme.</p>

<p>After leaving her I was taken in hand again by my two
chamberlains, and walked some distance across one or
two courts, always meeting more chamberlains escorting
colleagues, principally men, all in uniform and orders,
doing the same thing, and trying to get on as fast as
they could. My next visit was to the Grand Duchess
Constantine. When we got to the anteroom and small
salon we found them full of gentlemen, who proved to be
our Mission, who had arrived a few minutes before. That
made a slight change of programme, as the Grand
Duke decided to receive W. and me together with the
Duchess&mdash;accordingly we were received first, alone, in a
small room. The Grand Duke was standing close to the
door; the Grand Duchess in the centre of the room. He
is a sailor, looks very intelligent. She has been very
handsome, carries herself beautifully, and has a splendid
figure. He was in uniform&mdash;she in red velvet (she <em>didn't</em>
have on her emeralds&mdash;I suppose we shall see them all
to-morrow). They both talked very easily about all
sorts of things; Greece of course and the Schuylers, of
whom she spoke very warmly. Her daughter is the
Queen of Greece&mdash;I hope we shall see her, as I have
heard Gert talk so much about her. The Grand Duchess
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_61" title="pg 61"> </a>
said she was tired already, and the Ceremonies haven't
begun yet. She had received yesterday 100 ladies of
Moscow. They came in groups of 10, and she had to
find something to say to each one.</p>

<p>As soon as the audience was over W. asked permission,
as usual, to present the rest of the Mission. I remained
in the outer salon talking to the ladies-in-waiting. The
apartment is high, with a splendid view over Moscow.
They pointed me out several churches and curious roofs&mdash;were
much interested in all my visits and my clothes,
supposed I had quantities of trunks.</p>

<p>After that I departed again alone, and saw the Grand
Duchess Catherine, who was very amiable, but kept me a
few minutes only, as she had so many people to receive.
Then I took another long walk, and up several flights of
narrow, turning stairs (the chamberlains in front and
Richard behind) to the Duchesse d'Oldenburg. The
Belgian Mission was being received, so I waited in the
outer salon, and again W. and the gentlemen arrived,
and he and I were received together. Evidently they
like it better when we can go together, as it saves time
for them&mdash;and if we are tired, think what they must be.
I went off again alone, and was received by the Grand
Duchess Wladimir, who is charming&mdash;a German Princess.
She is young, a pretty figure, very well dressed in
white. She looked rather delicate, having just got over
a rather bad attack of measles. She dreads the fatigue
very much to-morrow, and had asked the Empress if she
might have a folding-chair, a pliant of some kind, but her
"demande n'a pas &eacute;t&eacute; accueillie favorablement. L'Imperatrice
elle-m&ecirc;me sera debout tout le temps. Il faudrait
absolument que nous fassions comme elle." I didn't
mention my pliant, as I am quite sure no one will notice
to-morrow anything <em>I</em> do.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_62" title="pg 62"> </a></p>

<p>That finished my audience, and I had been standing or
walking since I left the Embassy, so I was glad to find
the carriage, which was by no means easy. There were
quantities at the Kremlin, and as we never by any chance
came out at the same door by which we went in, and the
coachman was told to follow, he naturally had some difficulty
in getting it. Also it is raining hard, which complicates
matters. There are carpets down to the doors,
but so many people have passed over them that they are
just as wet and muddy as the streets. We met all the rest
of the Mission at the Embassy door, and then there was
a general d&eacute;tente, the men all calling for their servants
to get them out of their uniforms, and to bring beer and
cigars.</p>

<p>W. came in to tea. He looked really done up&mdash;he
had been at it steadily since 12. There are so many
Princes and Grand Dukes without any wives. I am
writing in bits, but will finish as usual the last thing. We
have had a small dinner&mdash;the other French Embassy
(permanent), Lagren&eacute;, Consul, and Orloff. Benckendorff
of course. They all went away early, as our day
to-morrow is an awful one.</p>

<p>It is pouring still, and we are rather melancholy at
the thought of our gala carriages, and blue and silver
liveries in a heavy rain. Just before dinner I had a visit
from Philippe, and he made various essais with my diadem
and feathers. He is to be here at six to-morrow
morning to coiffer me. He also requested that he might
see my dress so as to make his coiffure "harmoniser avec
l'ensemble." I wanted to see it too, so as to be sure that
everything was right, and the flowers well sewn on. It
is now reposing on one of the big arm-chairs in the dressing-room,
covered up with a sheet.</p>

<p>My eyes are shutting of themselves, so I will stop.

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_63" title="pg 63"> </a>
Please send all my letters on to America, as I never can
write <em>two</em> accounts of our life here.</p>

Dimanche, 27 Mai, 1883.</p>

<p>I am perfectly exhausted, Dear, after the most beautiful,
bewildering, exhausting day I have ever gone
through. We got home at 4.30. I rested a little, had tea
as usual in my boudoir with W. and Richard, and will
write as much as I can while I am still under the impression
of all I have seen.</p>

<p>I was up at 5.30, as we had to leave here at 7. Philippe
was very punctual&mdash;put on diadem and feathers
very well. Happily it was all blue, rather dark (as my
dress too was blue), and he remarked pleasantly, to put
me at my ease I think, and make me feel as comfortable
as I could at that hour of the morning, "Le bleu c'est
le fard de Madame." He couldn't understand that I
wouldn't let him maquiller my face&mdash;said all the Princesses
were painted&mdash;but I really couldn't go that.</p>

<p>When I appeared in the drawing-room, the men of
the Embassy were very complimentary about my dress.
We went in our three carriages (I had the white moir&eacute;
cloak, trimmed with dark feathers over me), W. and I
and Pont&eacute;coulant in the first gala carriage driven by
Leroy (I wish you could have seen him, as much taken
up with <em>his dress</em> as I was with mine). He stood giving
directions to a quantity of understrappers, but never
touching harness, nor even whip, until we appeared, then
got on his box as we got into the carriage, settled himself
in a fine pose, and we started.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_64" title="pg 64"> </a></p>

<p>The second gala carriage driven by Hubert (who
looked very well) came next, and then the d'Orsay. It
really was a very pretty cort&eacute;ge, and we were much
looked at and admired, as we drove very slowly, and
jolting very much, to the German Embassy. All our
colleagues came up about the same time. Some of the
gala carriages were good, the Austrian, but ours out and
out the best. No one else had three.</p>

<p>We assembled in one of the large rooms of the palace,
and then walked through numerous rooms, galleries, and
finally through an open court, entirely covered with a
red carpet, and lined with soldiers and officers&mdash;every
description of uniform. The Chevalier-Gardes, magnificent
in their white tunics, silver cuirasses and helmets.
Happily it was fine&mdash;I don't know what we should have
done in the rain, and also so early in the morning the
sun was not g&ecirc;nant (as it was later in the day). The long
procession, the men in uniform and decorations; the
women in full dress, feathers and diadems, was most
effective.</p>

<p>I left my cloak in the carriage, and didn't feel chilly,
but some of the women were uncomfortable, and had
little lace and fur tippets. We filed into the church
(which is small), and into the Diplomatic Tribune, and
settled ourselves quite easily&mdash;there was plenty of room.
The effect inside was dazzling: tapers, flowers, pictures,
jewels, quantities of women already seated, all in the
Kakoshnik, and a general impression of red and gold in
their costumes. All the Empress's ladies wear red velvet
trains, embroidered in gold. People seemed to be
coming in all the time. Deputations from the provinces,
officials of Moscow, officers, chamberlains, a moving
mass of colour. The costume of the Popes was gorgeous&mdash;cloth
of gold with very high jewelled mitres.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_65" title="pg 65"> </a></p>

<p>We waited some time before the ceremony began, but
there was so much to see that we didn't mind, and from
time to time one of the officials came and stood with us
a little, explaining who all the people were. The whole
church was hung with red, and red carpets everywhere.
Just in the middle there was a high estrade, covered with
red velvet, and a great gold baldaquin with Imperial
eagles embroidered on it. It was all surrounded by a
gold balustrade, and on it were the two thrones. A little
lower on the same estrade were the places of the Princes
of the family, and the Foreign Princes.</p>

<p>A little before 9 the Imperial family began to arrive.
Almost all the Grand Duchesses in trains of drap d'argent,
bordered with sable, and magnificent jewels. Then
there was a great sound of trumpets, and cheering outside
(those curious, suppressed Russian cheers), and they
told us the Emperor and Empress were coming. They
were preceded by an officer of the Chevalier-Gardes, with
sabre-&agrave;-nu. The Emperor was in full uniform, with the
blue ribbon of St. Andr&eacute;. The Empress quite simple in
white and silver, the Imperial eagles embroidered on the
front of her dress; no diadem, no veil, nor jewels;
her train carried by 4 pages, her hair quite simply
done&mdash;she looked so young, quite like a school-girl.
Then followed a glittering suite of Princes, officers,
etc.</p>

<p>The service was very long, the chanting quite fine; the
men have beautiful, deep voices&mdash;I cared less for the intoning,
they all end on such a peculiar high note. I
didn't like the looks of the Popes either&mdash;the long beards
worried me. Of course the real interest was when the
Emperor took the crown from the hands of the Pope
(kneeling before him) and put it on his own head. He
looked a magnificent figure, towering over everybody,

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_66" title="pg 66"> </a>
as he stood there in his Imperial robes, cloth of gold
lined with ermine, and a splendid jewelled collar. The
crown looked high and heavy&mdash;made entirely of jewels.</p>

<p>His two brothers, Grand Dukes Wladimir and Alexis,
put on his robes. The Grand Duke Wladimir always
stands close behind his brother. He has a stern, keen
face. He would be the Regent if anything should happen
to the Emperor, and I think his would be an iron
rule.</p>

<p>As soon as the Emperor was crowned the Empress
left her seat, came to the middle of the platform, made
a deep curtsey to the Emperor, and knelt. Her court
ladies then gathered around her, and put on the Imperial
mantle, also in cloth of gold lined with ermine, and the
same jewelled collar like the Emperor's. When she was
dressed, the Emperor, stooping low over her, put on her
crown, a small one made entirely in diamonds, raised her
and kissed her. As she stood a moment she almost staggered
back under the weight of the mantle&mdash;the 4 pages
could hardly hold it.</p>

<p>Then the long procession of Princes and Princesses
left their seats on the estrade, and passed before the
Sovereigns. First came his two brothers, Wladimir and
Alexis. They kissed the Emperor, then bent low before
the Empress, kissing her hand. She kissed them each
on the forehead. Next came the two young Princes, in
uniform like their father, wearing also the blue ribbon
of St. Andr&eacute;, and the little Grand Duchess (aged 10)
in a short white dress, but the Kakoshnik.</p>

<p>It was a pretty sight to see the children bowing and
curtseying low to their parents. Some of the ladies'
curtseys were wonderful&mdash;the Arch Duchess Charles
Louis extraordinarily graceful (I wonder how I ever shall
get through mine&mdash;I am certainly much less souple than
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_67" title="pg 67"> </a>
these ladies). When they had all passed the Emperor
went alone into the chapel to communier, and receive the
sacred oil&mdash;the Empress remained kneeling outside.</p>

</a>

<p class="center">The Emperor Crowning the Empress Church de l'Assomption</p></div>

<p>We had various incidents in our tribune&mdash;one or two
ladies fainted, but couldn't get out, they had to be
propped up against the rail, and brought round with fans,
salts, etc. We stood for three hours and a half.</p>

<p>The Emperor and Empress left the church with the
same ceremony (we all following), and then there was
a curious function. Under a dais, still in their court
robes, their trains carried by six or eight officers, they
walked around the enceinte, going into three or four
churches to make their devotions, all of us and all the
other Princes following, all their suites, and an accompaniment
of bells, cannon, music, and cheers. (I forgot
to say that when the Emperor put his crown on his head
in the church, the cannon announced to his people that
their sovereign was crowned.)</p>

<p>We had a few drops of rain, then the sun came out
strong, and I was rather wretched&mdash;however G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
Pitti&eacute; came to my rescue, and shaded me with his hat (all
the men were bareheaded). There were tribunes all
along the route for the people who hadn't been able to
get into the church; in one of them all the younger members
of the Embassies, as of course <em>all</em> couldn't be got
inside. These two were all gold and red, filled with
women, mostly in white, and men in uniform. You can't
imagine what a gorgeous sight it was, and the crowd
below packed tight, all gaping at the spectacle.</p>

<p>We didn't dirty our dresses (the trains of course we
carried in our arms), I don't know why, as the red carpet
was decidedly damp and muddyish in places. We
finally arrived at the Vieux Palais, where we were to
breakfast, and the Emperor and Empress were also to

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_68" title="pg 68"> </a>
have a little respite before dining in state with their
people.</p>

<p>We had a handsome breakfast, quantities of gold and
silver plate, and many Russian dishes. I didn't much like
the looks of the soup, which was clear, but had various
things floating about on it&mdash;uncooked fish, little black
balls, which I thought might be caviar, which I don't ever
like; and I was rather wondering what I should eat (I was
very hungry), when my neighbor, Nigra, the Italian Ambassador,
suggested I should share his meal. He didn't
like Russian cookery either, so he had intrigued with a
friendly official, who was going to bring him a cold
chicken and a bottle of good red wine. I accepted joyfully,
and we had a very good breakfast.</p>

<p>I think we were about three-quarters of an hour at
table, and it was very pleasant to sit down after those
hours of standing. When the breakfast was over, a little
after two, we were conducted to the Imperial dining-room,
a square, low room in the old Kremlin with a
vaulted ceiling, and heavy Byzantine decorations; quantities
of paintings on a gold ground, bright coloured frescoes,
most elaborate. There were great buffets and
tables covered with splendid gold and silver plates, flagons,
vases, etc. At the end of the room was a square,
raised platform covered with red, and a splendid dais, all
purple velvet, ermine, and gold embroidery where the
Imperial couple were to dine with their faithful subjects.</p>

<p>We strangers were merely admitted for a few minutes
to see the beginning of the meal, and then we retired, and
the Emperor remained alone with his people. Of course
officers and officials of all descriptions were standing
close round the platform. There was a large table to the
left as we came in, where almost all the Russians were
already assembled&mdash;all the women in the national dress,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_69" title="pg 69"> </a>
high Kakoshnik, long white lace spangled veil, and a sort
of loose hanging sleeve which was very effective. The
ensemble was striking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%"><a href="#illustrations"><img src="images/illus082.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Illustration: Empress Marie in her Coronation Robes" id="illus082" title="Empress Marie in her Coronation Robes"> </a>
<p class="center small">Empress Marie in her Coronation Robes</p>
</div>

<p>Presently we heard a sound of music and trumpets,
which told us the Royalties were approaching, and as
they came near we heard the familiar strains of the Polonaise
from Glinka's opera "La Vie pour le Czar," which
is always played when the Emperor and Empress appear.
They came with the usual escort of officers and
chamberlains, smiling and bowing graciously to all of us.
They seated themselves (always in their cloth of gold
mantles, and crowns on their heads) on the two throne
chairs; a small table was placed in front of them, and then
the dinner began.</p>

<p>The soupi&egrave;re was preceded by a chamberlain in gold
lace; held by a Master of Ceremonies, and flanked on
each side by a gigantic Chevalier-garde, sabre-&agrave;-nu.
There was always a collection of officials, chamberlains,
pages, etc., bringing up the rear of the cort&eacute;ge, so that at
each entr&eacute;e a little procession appeared. We saw three
dishes brought in with the same ceremony&mdash;the fish was
so large on a large silver dish that <em>two</em> Masters of Ceremonies
held that.</p>

<p>It was really a wonderful sight, like a picture in some
old history of the Moyen Age. As soon <ins title="Transcriber's note: image read 'the' here.">as</ins> the Sovereigns
had taken their places on the thrones all the
Russians at their table sat down too. We couldn't, because
we had nothing to sit upon, so we remained standing
at the end of the room, facing the estrade. They
told us that when the Emperor raised his glass and asked
for wine that was the signal for us to retire; and that it
would be after the roast. (All our instructions were
most carefully given to us by Benckendorff, who felt his
responsibility.) Think what his position would have

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_70" title="pg 70"> </a>
been if any member of <em>his</em> Embassy had made a "gaffe."
Accordingly as soon as the roast made its appearance
all our eyes were riveted upon the Emperor. He
raised his glass slowly (very high) to give us time.
General Schweinitz, as Doyen, stepped well forward, and
made a very low bow. We all bowed and curtseyed low
(my knees are becoming more supple) and got ourselves
out backwards. It wasn't very difficult, as we had
our trains over our arms.</p>

<p>I don't think we shall see anything more curious than
that state banquet. I certainly shall never see again a
soup tureen guarded by soldiers with drawn swords.</p>

<p class="author">10 o'clock.</p>

<p>We dined quietly, everyone giving his experiences&mdash;of
course the younger members of the Embassy, who
had no places in the church, had a better impression of
the ensemble than we had. They said the excitement
and emotion of the crowd in the square before the church
was extraordinary. All crossed themselves, and many
cried, when the cannon told them that the Emperor was
crowned. They seem to be an emotional, superstitious
race. They also said the procession around the courts,
when the Emperor and Empress were going to the various
churches, was wonderful&mdash;a moving mass of feathers,
jewels, banners, bright helmets, and cuirasses, all
glittering in the sun.</p>

<p>After dinner we drove about a little, seeing the illuminations,
but the crowd was so dense we could hardly
move, though the soldiers did all they could, and battered
the people about. Then it began to rain a little, so I
begged to come home. It is raining quite hard now&mdash;I
hear it on the marquise. Heavens how tired I am.</p>

<p>Of course I can't write half of what I have seen, but

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_71" title="pg 71"> </a>
the papers will keep you quite au courant. Some of the
newspaper correspondents were in the church, and of
course plenty in the tribunes outside. Our carriages
certainly made a great effect, and we were cheered various
times on our way home.</p>

<p>Madame Hubert talks so much she can hardly get
me my things. She is as much pleased with her husband's
appearance as I am with mine. What an experience
for them, when you think that she had never been
out of Villers-Cotterets and Bourneville when she came
to us, and Paris seemed a Paradise.</p>

Monday, May 28th, 1883.</p>

<p>We were all again in Court dress at 11 this morning to
go to the Palace and present our felicitations to the Imperial
couple. I wore the same blue dress, as my pink
one goes on to-night for the "courtag" at the Palace. It
seems there was some misunderstanding about our being
received this morning, so some of our colleagues had
come, and gone, rather put out at the vagueness of the
instructions. We decided to remain, as we had arrived
there in all our finery, particularly as one of the chamberlains
told us it would be most interesting. Deputations
from the provinces were to present addresses of
felicitation and we would see all the national costumes.</p>

<p>As we had some time to wait, the Greek chamberlain
suggested that we should take advantage of that opportunity
to be presented to the Queen of Greece. He
thought he could arrange it, so he went off to her
rooms, and presently reappeared with the maid of honour,
Mlle. Colocotroni (a friend of Gertrude's), and we
were taken at once to the Queen, who was standing in

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_72" title="pg 72"> </a>
a small salon overlooking the river. She is young and
handsome, fair, stoutish, but tall enough to carry it off
well, and was chatty and sympathetic&mdash;said she supposed
I was quite tired after yesterday, that it was certainly very
trying; that the person who was the least tired was the
Empress. She had met her in one of the corridors in
the interval between the ceremony at the church, or
rather the churches (as she went to three after leaving
the Assomption). She had taken off her Imperial mantle
and crown, and was going to see one of her numerous
relations before beginning again.</p>

<p>As soon as our audience was over we returned to the
large audience hall, where we found Benckendorff tearing
his hair, in a wild state, because we were late&mdash;all our
colleagues had taken their places. However we were in
time, and ranged ourselves, the ladies all together on
the right, the men opposite. I was the Doyenne, and
stood at the head of the column (as neither Lady Thornton
nor Mdme. Schweinitz was there). All about the
room were groups of people from the provinces waiting
their turn, but there was such a crowd of uniforms and
costumes that one could hardly distinguish anything.</p>

<p>Presently the Court appeared&mdash;the Emperor always in
uniform, the Empress in a very handsome train, blue velvet,
embroidered in gold, and a splendid tiara, necklace
and front of sapphires. They had the usual train of
Princes, chamberlains, aides-de-camp, etc. As soon as
they had taken their places on the platform all the
Missions (men) advanced according to their rank. The
Ambassador made a few steps forward, said a few words
of felicitation to the Emperor (the Mission remaining at
a respectful distance behind), then made a low bow, and
all retired &agrave; reculons.</p>

<p>The Austrian Embassy looked very well&mdash;the Hungarian

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_73" title="pg 73"> </a>
uniforms are so handsome. The Americans also
very well, though they have no uniform, wear ordinary
black evening clothes. The Admiral and his two aides-de-camp
of course wore theirs, but it is so quiet, dark
blue with little lace, and no orders, that one would
hardly have remarked it except for the epaulettes and
aiguillettes.</p>

<p>As soon as all the men of the Corps Diplomatique had
passed the Empress left her place and came to us. Her
train was carried by 4 pages, a high official, red velvet and
gold lace, carrying the extreme end. She passed down
the line of ladies, saying something to each one. I heard
her speak three languages&mdash;English, French, and German&mdash;quite
easily.</p>

<p>We waited until the Court retired, and then there was
the usual stampede for the carriages. I have not been
out again this afternoon. We start for our Court ball
at 8.45, and of course dine early. I was interrupted by
Philippe, who came to coiffer me, having as usual
stopped in the lingerie to inspect my dress, the pink one
this time. He tells me he began to dress some of the
heads for to-night at 12 this morning.</p>

Mardi, 29 Mai, 1883.</p>

<p>I will begin my letter while I am waiting to go with
some of the gentlemen and Benckendorff to see the
preparations for the great people's f&ecirc;te. I couldn't write
last night, I was so tired out. Two court dresses and
functions, and hours of standing is a good deal for one
day. We started early, at a quarter to 9. We assembled

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_74" title="pg 74"> </a>
in the same room in the old Kremlin where the
Imperial couple had dined this afternoon. Almost all
our colleagues and some of the swell Russians were already
there, and everyone moved about, talking and
looking until the welcome strains of the march told us
the Emperor and Empress were coming.</p>

<p>One of the chamberlains showed me some of the most
curious old bowls and flagons. The work is rather
rough, and the stones enormous&mdash;not well cut&mdash;but the
effect is good, half barbaric. The Court appeared always
with the same brilliant suite&mdash;the Empress looked
charming in a pink velvet train, embroidered in silver.
All the Grand Duchesses in drap d'argent, bordered with
beautiful black sable.</p>

<p>As soon as the Court arrived the polonaise began; the
Emperor making the first with Queen of Greece, the
Empress with Schweinitz. It was a charming sight. All
the trains were &eacute;tal&eacute;es their full length. The gentleman
takes his partner's hand, holding it very high, and they
make a stately progress through the rooms. I didn't
dance the first one. We had a very good view of the
whole thing. It was a beautiful sight&mdash;the men all in
uniform, with orders, and broad ribbons; and the women
with their trains down the full length. The Russian
trains, of white and silver bordered with fur, made a great
effect.</p>

<p>The Emperor danced (which is a fa&ccedil;on de parler only,
as one walked through the rooms) with the Queen of
Greece, Arch Duchess Charles Louis, and the Ambassadrices
Lady Thornton, Mdme. Jaur&egrave;s, Countess Dudzeele,
and me&mdash;the Empress with the 6 Ambassadors.
I danced the second polonaise with the Grand Duke
Wladimir, who is handsome and spirited looking. He
told me who many of the people were. In one of the

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_75" title="pg 75"> </a>
rooms were all the Russian women, not in costume, but
in ordinary ball dress, all, however, wearing the Kakoshnik
studded with jewels, and most becoming it was.</p>

<p>I was much interested (before my turn came) to see
how the ladies got back to their places after having been
deposited by the Emperor in the middle of the room. He
doesn't conduct his partner back as all the others do.
He goes back to his own place, the lady makes a curtsey,
and gets back to hers across the room backwards as well
as she can. They seemed to get through all right. I
rather enjoyed my polonaise with the Emperor. He
showed me quantities of people&mdash;a splendid man from
some part of Asia dressed in white, with jewels, coloured
stones mostly, all down the front of his coat, and pistols
in his belt with jewelled hilts. Also the Khan of Khiva,
with all the front of his high fur cap covered with jewels,
also his belt, which seemed made entirely of diamonds
and rubies.</p>

<p>The music was always the march from Glinka's opera;
each band in turn taking it up as the cort&eacute;ge passed
through the rooms. The last Polonaise finished about
11.30, and the Court immediately retired. We had no
refreshments of any kind, and made the same rush for the
carriages.</p>

<p>Our rentr&eacute;e to the Embassy is most amusing&mdash;the
whole Mission precedes us, and when we arrive we find
them ranged in a semicircle at the foot of the staircase,
waiting to receive us. Richard says he never understood
the gulf that separates an Ambassador Extraordinary
from ordinary mortals until he accompanied his
brother to Moscow.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_76" title="pg 76"> </a></p>

<p class="author">5 o'clock.</p>

<p>We had rather an interesting afternoon. We met one
of the committee at the place, sort of great plain, or
meadow, where the F&ecirc;te Populaire is to be, near the
Petrofski Palace, where the Emperor stayed before he
made his public entr&eacute;e into Moscow, who showed us
everything. There are quantities of little sheds or baraques,
where everybody (and there will be thousands,
he tells us) will receive a basket with a meat p&acirc;t&eacute;, a
p&acirc;t&eacute; of confitures, a cake, and a package of bonbons.
There are also great barrels of beer, where everyone can
go with a mug and drink as much as he can hold.</p>

<p>We asked M. (I forget his name) how it was possible
to take precautions with such a crowd of people, but he
said they anticipated no danger, it was the "people's
day," which sounded to us rather optimistic. It was
rather nice driving about.</p>

<p>Now I have just been, at the request of Lhermite, to
look at his table, as we have our first big dinner to-night
(all Russians); all the flowers, "Roses de France," have
just arrived from Paris&mdash;three nights on the road; they
look quite fresh and beautiful,&mdash;were packed alone in
large hampers. I shall wear my blue tulle ball-dress
to-night, as we go to the ball at the Governor's Palace
after dinner.</p>

<p class="author">Wednesday, 30th.</p>

<p>Our dinner was pleasant last night. As it was entirely
Russian we had the curious meal they all take just before
dinner. A table was spread in the small salon opening
into the dining-room, with smoked and salted fish,
caviare, cucumbers, anchovies, etc. They all partook,
and then we passed into the dining-room, where the real
business began. I sat between M. de Giers, Foreign
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_77" title="pg 77"> </a>
Minister, and Count Worontzoff, Ministre de la Cour.
They were very pleasant, and rather amusing over the
exigencies of the suites of the foreign Princes; the
smaller the Power the more important the chamberlains,
equerries, etc.&mdash;rather like our own experience the year
of the Exhibition in Paris, where a Baden equerry, I
think, was forgotten (which of course was most improper
at the Quai d'Orsay), and most delicate negotiations
were necessary. Both gentlemen were very complimentary
over the dinner and the flowers&mdash;asked where in
Moscow we had been able to find them, and could hardly
believe they had arrived this morning, three nights and
three days on the road. They were beautiful, those
lovely pink "Roses de France," which looked quite
charming with the dark blue S&egrave;vres china.</p>

<p>The guests went off about 10; and we half an hour
later to the great ball. I wore my light blue tulle
with silver braid; and I will add that I left the greater
part of the tulle at the Palace. Happily the silk under-skirt
was strong, or else I should have stood in my petticoats.
The crowd and heat was something awful&mdash;the
staircase was a regular bousculade, and I was thankful
those big Russian spurs merely tore my flounces, and
didn't penetrate any further. We finally arrived, struggling
and already exhausted, in the ballroom, where we
found all the Grand Dukes and Grand Duchesses already
assembled to receive the Emperor.</p>

<p>We had some little time to wait, so they all came over
and talked to us. The Queen of Greece is most attractive&mdash;so
simple. She noticed that my dress was torn and
flowers crushed, but said, what was quite true, that no
one would remark it in the crowd. We soon heard the
sound of the March, and then there was such a rush
towards the door by which the Emperor and Empress
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_78" title="pg 78"> </a>
were to enter that we quickly withdrew into the embrasure
of the window, and let the torrent pass. They tried
to make a circle, but it was impossible. The crowd was
dense. W. and I made our way quickly to the head of
the stairs and waited there, as they had told us the Emperor
would not stay long&mdash;merely make a tour through
the rooms.</p>

<p>They appeared very soon, shook hands with us both,
and seemed very glad to get away. The Empress was
in light blue, with a beautiful diamond tiara. It is rather
pretty to see the Grand Duke Wladimir <em>always</em> close to
his brother, to shield him from any danger. We were
all rather cross when we got home.</p>

<p>This morning I have been shopping with W., Richard,
and Pont&eacute;coulant. It is rather an unsatisfactory performance,
as we can't either speak or understand Russian.
In the bazaars and real Moscow shops they know nothing
but Russian. We take the little polygot boy with us (always
ahead in his little droshky) but as he invariably announces
"la grande Ambassade" we <em>see</em> the prices go up.
Some of the enamel and gold and silver work is beautiful.
Richard was quite fascinated with the Madonnas,
with their black faces and wands, set in a handsome frame
of gold, with light blue enamel. He bought two, one
for Louise and one for me, which I am delighted to have.
We bought various little boxes, some of lacquer, others
in silver, rather prettily worked, and a variety of fancy
spoons, buckles, etc.</p>

<p>I must stop now and dress. We dine at 6, so as to be
at the Op&eacute;ra at 9. We shall go "en gala," our three
carriages, as it is a fine warm night. The detective is a
little anxious for to-night (it would be such a good opportunity
to get rid of all the Russian Princes, to say
nothing of the foreigners). He and Pont&eacute;coulant suggested
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_79" title="pg 79"> </a>
to W. that I should be left at home, but I protested
vigorously. If they all go, I am going too. I
don't feel very nervous, I wonder why; for it really is a
little uncomfortable&mdash;unusual to hesitate about going to
the Op&eacute;ra because one might be blown up.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author">Jeudi, May 31st, 1883.</p>

<p>I was too tired to write last night, though the opera
was over fairly early. It was a beautiful sight, the house
brilliantly lighted and crowded, nothing but uniforms,
orders, and jewels. There was one dark box, which of
course attracted much attention; the Americans&mdash;all the
men in black, except the three naval officers&mdash;(we were
acclam&eacute;s all along the route, and I must say Leroy and
Hubert looked very well in their tricornes and powdered
wigs). I wore the cr&egrave;me embroidered velvet with blue
satin front, tiara, and blue feathers in my hair. I fancy
Philippe had made a sort of tower on the top of my
head, but he again assured me I must have a "coiffure de
circonstance."</p>

<p>The square before the Op&eacute;ra was brilliantly lighted
(they certainly light most beautifully in Russia&mdash;thousands
of candles everywhere), a red carpet down, and
quantities of palms and flowers&mdash;always also quantities
of gilded gentlemen. We didn't wait very long for the
Court to appear&mdash;about a quarter of an hour&mdash;and were
much taken up looking at everything, and everybody,
and trying to recognize our friends. A large box at one
end of the house, opposite the stage, was reserved for
the Royalties, all draped of course in red and gold.</p>

<p>Everyone rose when the Emperor and Empress arrived,
always with their brilliant cort&eacute;ge of Princes. One
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_80" title="pg 80"> </a>
of the most striking uniforms was the Prince of
Montenegro's, but they all made a fine show, and a most
effective background for the women&mdash;the orchestra playing
the Russian Hymn, the chorus singing it, all the
house applauding, and all eyes fixed on the Royal box.</p>

<p>It was really magnificent, and the Emperor looked
pleased. They gave the first act of Glinka's opera "La
Vie pour le Czar." When the curtain fell the whole
house rose again; when the Emperor and Empress left
their box there was a general movement among the people,
and some of our colleagues had come to pay us a visit
when Count Worontzoff (Ministre de la Cour) appeared
and said, "Sa Majest&eacute;" hoped we would come and have
tea with her, and he would have the honour of showing
us the way; so he gave me his arm and took me to the
foyer, which was very well arranged with flowers, plants,
and red carpets.</p>

<p>There were several round tables. He took me to the
Empress' table, where were the Queen of Greece, Grand
Duchesses Constantine and Wladimir, Lady Thornton,
and Madame Jaur&egrave;s; also Nigra, Schweinitz, and a
brother of the Shah de Perse. The Empress looked so
young, in white, with a broad red ribbon, and splendid
diamonds. The Queen of Greece was charming, asked
me if I ever found time to write to Francis. The Emperor
didn't sit down&mdash;he walked about between the
tables, and talked to everybody.</p>

<p>We stayed, I should think, about half an hour at the
tea-table, and then went back to the theatre. The ballet
was long, but interesting, all the mazurkas of the Empire
were danced in costume. We got our carriages easily
enough, and the arrangements were good. The younger
members of the Mission who didn't go for tea with the
Empress found the entr'acte long.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, June 2d.</p>

<p>I couldn't write yesterday, Dear, for I was in bed until
dinner-time, thoroughly tired out. Neither W. nor I
went to the ball on Thursday night given by the "Noblesse
de Moscou." I hoped to be able to go to the ball
of the German Embassy last night, but I couldn't do that
either. I felt rather better about 6 o'clock, and sent for
my dress, as W. particularly wanted me to go, but the
minute I stood up and tried to dress I was half fainting,
so there was no use persisting.</p>

<p>The fatigue has been something awful, and the hours
of standing have made it impossible to put on my Paris
shoes, and I have been obliged to buy white satin <em>boats</em>
at one of the Moscow shoemakers. The bootmakers
will make his fortune, as it seems everybody is in the
same state. The Empress even can't wear her usual
shoes, and all the women have left off coquettish little
shoes that match their dresses, and taken to these rather
primitive chaussures.</p>

<p>W. and all the gentlemen went to the ball, and said
it was very handsome&mdash;everything, silver, supper, servants,
etc., had been sent from Berlin. Madame
Schweinitz, who has a young baby, arrived from Petersburg
the morning of the ball. Count Eulenbourg&mdash;one
of the German Emperor's Ma&icirc;tres des C&eacute;r&eacute;monies&mdash;had
also arrived to decide about the questions of precedence,
place, etc. The Court remained to supper, so of course
the Ambassadors were obliged to stay. W. got home at
2 o'clock, very late for this country, where everything
begins early.</p>

<p>Richard and Pont&eacute;coulant are getting great friends.
Pont&eacute;coulant blagues<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5">[5]</a></sup> him all the time&mdash;says he is getting
a perfect courtier, and that his electors in the Seine
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_82" title="pg 82"> </a>
Inf&eacute;rieure would be scandalized if they could see him. I
must dress now for the "F&ecirc;te Populaire," and will write
more when I get back.</p>

<p class="author">9 o'clock.</p>

<p>I have retired to my own quarters. W. dines with
Nigra, so I have remained in my dressing-room, as
I have still a "fond de fatigue." The F&ecirc;te Populaire
was interesting. The day has been beautiful, and
there was not a hitch of any kind. The drive out
was interesting, on account of the people, a steady stream
of peasants of all ages going the same way. We went
at once to the Loge Imp&eacute;riale, a large pavilion erected at
the entrance facing the great plain. The space was so
enormous that one hardly distinguished anything. The
booths and towers looked like little spots, and they were
very far off. The Emperor and Empress never left the
Loge. He certainly didn't go down and walk about
among the people, as some enthusiastic gentlemen had
told us he would. Of course all the same people were
assembled in the Loge&mdash;Diplomatists, Court officials,
officers, etc. There was a cold lunch always going on.</p>

<p>There were many white dresses&mdash;all Russian women
wear white a great deal at any age. The Princess
Kotchoubey&mdash;78 years old&mdash;who put the Imperial mantle
on the Empress the day of the sacre, and who had
done the same thing for the late Empress, was dressed
entirely in white, bonnet, mantle, everything.</p>

<p>The Court remained about an hour, and we left as soon
as they did. There was some little delay getting our
carriages, but on the whole the thing was well managed.
Already some people were coming away looking very
smiling, and carrying their baskets most carefully. I will
bring you one of the mugs they gave me with the chiffre
of the Emperor and Empress, and the date.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_83" title="pg 83"> </a></p>

<p class="author">Sunday, June 3d.</p>

<p>I stayed at home all the morning, quite pleased to have
nothing to do. This afternoon W., Pont&eacute;coulant, and I
went for a little turn. We got out of the carriage at the
Kremlin, and walked about, having a quiet look at
everything. The view from the terrace was enchanting,
the afternoon sun lighting up all the curious old buildings,
and bringing out the colours of everything.</p>

<p>This evening we have had a diplomatic dinner. I was
between Schweinitz and Sir Edward Thornton. Both of
them talked a great deal. After dinner I talked some
time to Hunt, whom I like very much. He says many
people, Russians particularly, couldn't understand why
he didn't wear his uniform&mdash;"ce n'est pas tr&egrave;s poli pour
nous." They can't conceive that the representative of a
great Power shouldn't be attired in velvet and gold like
all the rest of the Embassies.</p>

<p>The table was again covered with pink roses. They
just last through the dinner, and fall to pieces as soon as
they are taken out of the vases. Some of them looked
so fresh, not even in full bloom, that I thought I could
send some French roses to Countess Pahlen, and the
moment we left the dining-room Lhermite took them
off the table, but they fell to pieces in his hands, covering
the floor with their petals.</p>

<p class="author">Monday, June 4th.</p>

<p>This morning we have been photographed in the
court-yard&mdash;the whole establishment, gala carriages, servants,
horses, moujiks, maids, cooks, etc. First there
was the "classic" group of the Mission, W. and I seated
in front, with all the gentlemen standing around us. It
was very long getting the poses all right so as to show
everybody in an advantageous light; and as it is (judging

<a class="pagenum break" id="page_84" title="pg 84"> </a>
from the clich&eacute;) Fran&ccedil;ois de Corcelle looks as if he was
throttling me. Then came the group of the whole party,
and it was amusing to see how eager the Russian maids
and the stable-men were to be well placed. They stood
as still as rocks. We waited a little to see the gala carriages
and horses taken, but that was too long. The
horses were nervous, and never were quiet an instant.
Now someone has gone to get a drum&mdash;they think the
sudden noise may make them all look in the same direction
for a moment.</p>

<p>W. and I have been out for a turn&mdash;to the Kremlin
of course, which is really the most interesting part of
Moscow. There is always the same crowd hurrying and
jostling each other. We went all over St. Basile. The
inside is curious, with a succession of rooms and dark recesses,
but the outside is unique; such an agglomeration
of domes, steeples, bell-towers; all absolutely different in
shape and colour&mdash;perfectly barbarous, but very striking.</p>

<p>W. enjoys our quiet afternoon drives, the perpetual
representation, seeing always the same people, and saying
and hearing the same things, is beginning to tire
him. It is a curious life. We see nothing but the Court
and the people&mdash;no haute bourgeoisie nor intermediate
class, and yet they exist, people in finance and commercial
affairs. They certainly have had no part in the
show&mdash;I should think there must be great discontent.
The young generation certainly will never be satisfied to
be kept entirely out of everything. Some of them have
travelled, been educated in England, have handsome
houses, English horses, etc., but apparently they don't
exist&mdash;at least we have never seen any.</p>

<p>I must stop, as we dress and dine early for the Palace
Ball. My Dear, my dress is frightfully green (Delannoy's
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_85" title="pg 85"> </a>
green velvet coat over pink tulle). Of course we
chose it by candle-light, when it looked charming; but
as we dress and start by daylight I am rather anxious.
I consulted Pont&eacute;coulant, who came in just as the maids
were bringing it in. He said, "C'est bien vert, Madame."
Let us hope that the light of thousands of wax candles
may have a subduing effect.</p>

June 5, 1883.</p>

<p>The Palace ball was quite beautiful last night. I had
some misgivings as to my dress until we got to the
Palace, as the gentlemen of the Embassy had evidently
found me <em>very green</em> when we assembled in the great
hall before starting; however as soon as we arrived in
the big room of the Palace where we were all marshalled,
Countess Linden (an American born) said to me at once
"Oh, Mdme. Waddington, how lovely your pink roses
look on the <em>dark blue</em> velvet," so I knew it was all right.
I wore that dress of Delannoy's which she was sure would
be most effective&mdash;pink tulle skirts&mdash;with a green velvet
habit (chosen of course by candle-light) so that it did
look very green by daylight, and a wreath of pink roses
round the d&eacute;collet&eacute;. I remember both Henrietta and
Pauline were a little doubtful&mdash;but it certainly made
more effect than any dress I wore except the blue manteau
de cour. I will tell Delannoy. We always go in by
a special side entrance to these Palace functions, which
is a pity, as we miss the grand staircase, which they
told us was splendid with red carpets, soldiers, and gold-laced
gentlemen to-night. We waited some time, an
hour certainly, before the Court came, but as all the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_86" title="pg 86"> </a>
Corps Diplomatique were assembled there it was pleasant
enough, and we all compared our experiences and our
fatigue, for everybody was dead tired&mdash;the men more
than the women.</p>

<p>The rooms are magnificent&mdash;very high, and entirely
lighted by wax candles&mdash;thousands; one of the chamberlains
told me how many, but I would scarcely dare to
say. The Court arrived with the usual ceremony and
always the same brilliant suite of officers and foreign
Princes. The Emperor and Empress looked very smiling,
and not at all tired. She was in white, with splendid
diamonds and the broad blue ribbon of St. Andr&eacute;. He
always in uniform. As soon as they appeared the polonaises
began, this time three only, which the Emperor
danced with the ladies of the family. I danced the first
with the Grand Duke Wladimir. He is charming and
amiable, but has a stern face when he isn't smiling. I
think if the Russians ever feel his hand it will be a heavy
one. I danced the second with the Grand Duke Alexis,
and looked on at the third. It was not nearly so fine a
sight as the Court ball at the old palace. <em>There</em> the mixture
of modern life and dress and half barbaric costumes
and ornamentations was so striking; also the trains made
such an effect, being all &eacute;tal&eacute;d one was obliged to keep a
certain distance, and that gave a stately air to the whole
thing which was wanting last night when all the women
were in ordinary ball dress, not particularly long, so that
the cort&eacute;ge was rather crowded and one saw merely a
mass of jewelled heads (the dress was lost). Also they
merely walked around the ballroom, not going through
all the rooms as we did at the old palace.</p>

<p>When the polonaises were over there were one or two
waltzes. The Empress made several turns, but with the
Princes only, and we stood and looked on.</p>
<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_87" title="pg 87"> </a></p>

<p>While we were waiting there until someone should
come and get us for some new function I heard a sort of
scuffle behind me and a woman's impatient voice saying
in English "I can't bear it another moment," and a sound
of something falling or rolling across the floor. I turned
round and saw Mdme. A&mdash;&mdash; (a secretary's wife, also an
American) apparently struggling with something, and
very flushed and excited. I said, "What is the matter?"
"I am kicking off my shoes." "But you can never put
them on again." "I don't care if I never see them again&mdash;I
can't stand them another minute." "But you have
to walk in a cort&eacute;ge to supper with the Imperial party."
"I don't care at all, I shall walk in my stockings," then
came another little kick, and the slipper disappeared, rolling
underneath a heavy damask curtain. I quite sympathized
with her, as my beautiful white slippers (Moscow
manufacture) were not altogether comfortable, but I
think I should not have had the strength of mind to discard
them entirely. When I was dressing, Adelaide tried
to persuade me that I had better put on the pink satin
slippers that matched my dress; but my experience of the
hours of standing at all Russian Court functions had at
least taught me not to start with anything that was at all
tight.</p>

<p>While we were looking at the dancing the Grand Duke
Michel came over and asked me if I wouldn't come and
stand a little with the Grand Duchesses. He took me to a
little group where were the Grand Duchesses Michel and
Constantine and the Queen of Greece (she is always so
gay and natural). They at once asked me who had made
my dress, and what color it was. They had been talking
about it, and couldn't agree. The Grand Duchess Constantine
had on her emeralds, and beautiful they were&mdash;blocks
of stone, rather difficult to wear. She must have
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_88" title="pg 88"> </a>
been very handsome, has still a beautiful figure, and holds
herself splendidly.</p>

<p>We talked music a little&mdash;she said I ought to hear
some of the people's songs. I should like to very much,
but there doesn't seem any place where one can hear the
national songs. The men of the Embassy went one night
to the "Hermitage," where there was a little of everything,
and did hear some of the peasants singing their
national airs, but they didn't seem to think I could go.
While we were still talking there was a move, and they
said the Empress (who had been dancing all the time in
a small circle made for her at her end of the ballroom
and very strictly kept) was going to have tea. All the
Court and suite followed, and I was rather wondering
how to get back to my place and my colleagues when a
tall aide-de-camp came up and said he would have the
honour of conducting me to Her Majesty's tea&mdash;so we
started off across several rooms and corridors, which
were crowded, and arrived at a door where the two gigantic
negroes were standing. He said something&mdash;the
doors flew open&mdash;he made me a low bow and retired (as
he couldn't come any farther), and I found myself standing
alone in a large room with four or five tables&mdash;everyone
seated. For a moment I didn't know quite what
to do, and felt rather shy, but the Princess Kotchoubey,
Grande Ma&icirc;tresse, who was standing in the middle of the
room, came forward at once and took me to the Duchesse
d'Edimbourg's table, where there were also the
Arch-Duchess Charles Louis, the Duchess of Oldenburg,
a young Hessian Prince, and my two colleagues,
Lady Thornton and Madame Jaur&egrave;s.</p>

<p>We had tea and ices&mdash;didn't talk much, except the
Duchess of Edinburgh, who seems clever and ready to
talk&mdash;but I wasn't near her. I didn't see all the Ambassadors,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_89" title="pg 89"> </a>
mine certainly wasn't there, and of course very
few comparatively of our colleagues, as only Ambassadors
and their wives were invited to Her Majesty's tea
(no small fry, like Ministers).</p>

<p>I had the explanation of W.'s absence later. When
the Court moved off to tea General Wolseley suggested
that W. should come and smoke a cigar in his room. He
was lodged at the Kremlin with his Prince, the Duke of
Edinburgh. He, like a true Briton, had enough of bowing
and standing. W. was naturally quite of the same
opinion, so they picked up Admiral Seymour (also with
the Duke of Edinburgh) and had a very pleasant hour
smoking and talking until they were summoned for supper.
<em>That</em> they couldn't get out of, as we made a fine
procession directly behind the Court through all the
rooms to St. George's Hall&mdash;a great white high room
magnificently lighted, with tablets all around the walls
with the names of the Knights of the Order of St. George
who had died in battle, and a souper assis for 800 people.
Sir Edward Thornton, British Ambassador, took me.
As we were parading through the rooms between two
hedges of gaping people looking at the cort&eacute;ge, dresses,
diamonds, etc., I thought of Mdme. A&mdash;&mdash; and her
stockings, and wondered how she was getting on. I daresay
quite well; as she had a yellow satin dress and yellow
silk stockings perhaps no one noticed anything, and as
long as she didn't step on a needle or anything sharp she
was all right. Someone will find a nice little pair of
yellow satin shoes under the window-curtains in the ballroom
when the cleaning up is done after the f&ecirc;tes.</p>

<p>The hall was a blaze of light and jewels&mdash;a long table
across the end for the Imperial party, and all of us at two
long tables running the whole length of the room. The
gold and silver plate was very handsome, particularly the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_90" title="pg 90"> </a>
massive flambeaux and high ornaments for the middle of
the table. The supper was good, hot, and quickly served.
There was music all the time&mdash;singers, men and women,
in a gallery singing all sorts of Russian airs which nobody
listened to. The Emperor did not sit down to
supper. He remained standing in the middle of the
room talking to his gentlemen, and a few words to the
diplomatists when supper was over and one loitered a
little before going back to the ballroom. He certainly
doesn't care to talk to strangers&mdash;seeks them out very
little, and when he does talk it is absolutely banal. Is it
"paresse d'esprit" or great reserve?&mdash;one hardly knows.
I should think all this parade and function bored him
extremely. They say he is very domestic in his tastes,
and what he likes best is the country with his wife and
children.</p>

<p>After supper we went back to the ballroom for about
half an hour. Then the Court retired and we followed
them at once. We got our carriages fairly quickly.
There are always crowds in the streets waiting to see the
grand-monde pass. The Kremlin looks fairy-like as we
drive through&mdash;lights everywhere, some high, high up in
a queer little octagon green tower&mdash;then a great doorway
and staircase all lighted, with quantities of servants
and soldiers standing about; then a bit of rough pavement
in a half dark court and under a little low dark
gate with a shrine and Madonna at one end&mdash;all so perfectly
unmodern, and unlike anything else.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;  </p>

<p>I began my letter this morning before breakfast, but
didn't finish, as I was called off by some visits, and now
I will try and send this off by to-night's courier. We have
had a nice afternoon looking at the Tr&eacute;sor. Of course it
was very hurried&mdash;it would take weeks to see everything.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_91" title="pg 91"> </a>
The collection of state carriages and sleighs is interesting.
Almost all the carriages are French&mdash;either given
to the various Russian Sovereigns by French Kings, or
ordered in France by the Sovereigns themselves. The
great sledge in which Catharine II. made all her long
voyages is comfortable enough, and not unlike the "wagons
imp&eacute;riaux" in which we travelled from Varsovie to
Moscow.</p>

<p>Then we saw all the Coronation robes, crowns, sapphires,
swords, jewelled belts and collars, furs, etc., of
all the old Emperors from Ivan the Terrible down to the
late Emperor. Some of the crowns of the first Ivans
and Peters are extraordinary&mdash;a sort of high fur cap
covered with jewels, but heavy and roughly made&mdash;the
jewels always beautiful, such large stones, particularly
sapphires and rubies. There were vitrines full of splendid
gold and silver cups and dishes, presents to the Emperor
from all the different provinces.</p>

<p>They tell us the present Emperor has had magnificent
things given to him, but we have not seen them yet.
We met various people also going through the Museum,
and I had quite a talk with Radziwill (you know which
one I mean, who married Countess Malatesta's daughter).
It seemed funny to go back to the old Roman
days, and the evenings (prima-sera) in the Malatesta Palace.
He says everybody is worn out with the ceremonies
and the standing&mdash;however, to-night is the end,
with our dinner at the Palace.</p>

<p>I have again been interrupted&mdash;this time by a visit
from the Duc d'Aoste, whom I always find charming.
He is not at all expansive and very shy, but when one
breaks the ice he is interesting. He doesn't look like
anybody else, nor as if he belonged to this century. It
is quite the face one would see in any old Spanish picture&mdash;a
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_92" title="pg 92"> </a>
soldier-monk of Velasquez. He talked about the
Exhibition of '78, when W. was at the Foreign Office,
and I was almost tempted to tell him how embarrassed
we all were on the opening day when there were so many
Ex-Spanish Sovereigns&mdash;King Fran&ccedil;ois d'Assises, Queen
Isabella, and King Am&eacute;d&eacute;e. There was a big reception
in the evening at the Elys&eacute;e, and the Mar&eacute;chal
<sup><a href="#fn6" id="r6">[6]</a></sup> was
rather bothered with all his Spanish Royalties. However,
Queen Isabella and the Duc d'Aoste were evidently on
the best of terms. I saw them talking together, and I
believe all the Spaniards liked d'Aoste, though naturally
they wanted a King of their own race.</p>

<p>Here is Monsieur Philippe for his last coiffure, as he
says somewhat sadly. To-night's dinner is our last function.
We have then the revue, by daylight, of course,
and leave on Sunday for Petersburg.</p>

<p class="author">Wednesday, June 6th.</p>

<p>The gala dinner was handsome and <em>short</em> last night.
W. and I went off alone (none but chefs de mission were
invited) in the coup&eacute; d'Orsay, always with Benckendorff
in his carriage in front&mdash;W. in uniform, I in my white
and silver brocade, white feathers and diamonds in my
hair, no colour anywhere, not even on my cheeks, which
reduces Philippe to a state of prostrate stupefaction&mdash;"Madame
qui pourrait &ecirc;tre si bien."</p>

<p>We were received at the foot of the staircase and at
the doors by all the Chamberlains as usual and taken at
once to the same Salle St. George where we were to dine&mdash;all
at the Imperial table this time&mdash;about 500 couverts.
We were shown at once our seats&mdash;all the places
were marked, and we stood waiting behind our chairs
(like the footmen) for the Court to appear. I found myself
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_93" title="pg 93"> </a>
seated between the Duc d'Aoste and the young
Crown Prince of Sweden, so I was quite satisfied. One
of my colleagues was very anxious I should change the
papers&mdash;give her my Duke and take her's, who was never
civil to her, but would be perhaps to me, but I demurred,
as I knew mine would be nice, and I didn't know her's
at all. I don't think he was very nice to her, certainly
didn't talk much, but perhaps he never does.</p>

<p>We didn't wait very long. The Court was fairly
punctual&mdash;the Empress looked very nice, all in white
with diamonds. She had on her right the Duc d'Edimbourg
(who always had the place of honour), and on her
left the Prince Waldemar de Danemark, her brother. The
Emperor had the Queen of Greece on his right, the Arch
Duchess Charles Louis on his left. The dinner wasn't
bad, and was quickly served. The fish were enormous,
served on large silver dishes as big as boats. There was
always that curious Russian soup with all sorts of nondescript
things floating about on the surface. The Duc
d'Aoste was as nice as possible&mdash;said the Court officials
would be enchanted when everything was over, and all
the foreign Princes safely back in their own countries,
that the question of etiquette was something awful. As
soon as the Russian Court decided anything all the others
immediately protested&mdash;used all sorts of precedents, and
complicated matters in every way. I suggested that he
himself was difficult to place on account of the Duc de
Montpensier, who was here as a Spanish Prince, husband
of the Infanta. He replied "Absolument pas&mdash;je suis
ici comme prince italien, fr&egrave;re du roi," declining any sort
of Spanish souvenir.</p>

<p>When dinner was over we passed into the salle St. Andr&eacute;
for coffee, and that was funny too. As soon as the
Emperor and Empress made the move all our Dukes and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_94" title="pg 94"> </a>
Princes got up at once, and joined the Imperial procession,
and we followed all in a heap. There we had a
pleasant half hour, the Empress and the Grand Duchesses
came over and talked to us, hoped we were not tired,
that we had been interested, etc. I said to the Grand
Duchess Constantine that they must be enchanted to be
at the end of their functions, and to get rid of us all&mdash;but
she said not at all. She herself was much less tired
than when she began. She asked me what I had found
the most striking in all the ceremonies. I said certainly
the Coronation&mdash;first the moment when the Emperor
crowned himself&mdash;the only figure standing on the dais,
and afterwards when he crowned the Empress, she kneeling
before him.</p>

<p>The Empress asked me if I was going straight back to
France, but she didn't say, as so many of the others did,
"Ce n'est pas adieu pour vous, Mdme. Waddington, mais
au revoir, car vous reviendrez certainement." Admiral
Jaur&egrave;s having already resigned many people think W.
will be the next Ambassador, but he certainly won't
come.</p>

<p>About 9 the Court retired. We had dined at 7, so the
whole thing took about two hours. It was quite light
when we came out of the Palace, and when we got back
to the Maison Klein we found the Embassy just finishing
dinner, still in the dining-room. We sat a few minutes
with them telling our experiences. W. had been next to
the Grand Duchess Michel, who was very animated and
intelligent, and extremely well posted in all literary and
political matters, and fairly just for a Princess speaking
about a Republic.</p>

<p>Poor Pont&eacute;coulant has had a telegram telling him of
his brother's death. He is very much upset, and goes
off to-night. W. will miss him extremely&mdash;he was his
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_95" title="pg 95"> </a>
right-hand man. I have been out this morning shopping
with Fran&ccedil;ois de Courcelle. It isn't easy, as our
Russian is not fluent, but still we managed to find a few
things.</p>

<p>This afternoon I have been with Lagren&eacute; (Consul),
Sesmaisons, Corcelle, and Calmon to the great institution
of the "Enfants Trouv&eacute;s" fond&eacute;e par l'Imp&eacute;ratrice
Cath&eacute;rine II. There we found Admiral Jaur&egrave;s and all
his staff, and a director who showed us all over the
establishment&mdash;of course everything was in perfect order,
and perfectly clean (and I believe it always is), but I
should have preferred not having our visit announced,
so as to see the every-day working of the thing. We
went through quantities of rooms. In all, the Russian
nurses with their high head-dress (kakoshnik), the colour
of the room, were standing, and showed us most
smilingly their babies. The rooms are all known by
their colours and the nurses dressed to correspond. All
pink kakoshniks, for instance, in the pink room, blue
in the blue room, etc. It was rather effective when
all the women were standing in groups. The nurses
were decidedly young, some rather pretty faces, almost
all fair. The surveillante is a nice, kindly looking
woman. We saw the whole ceremony. In one of the
rooms of the rez-de-chauss&eacute;e we saw several women
waiting to take the children. The operation is always
the same&mdash;one writes down at once the name and age
of the child (which is generally written on a piece of
paper pinned on to the clothes), they are always very
young, 5 or 6 days old. Then they are undressed,
weighed, and carried off by one of the nurses, wrapped up
in a blanket, to a bath. After the bath they are dressed
in quite clean, nice garments, and the nurse gives them
the breast at once. All the rooms, dortoirs, salles-debain,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_96" title="pg 96"> </a>
laundries, kitchens, are as clean as possible, plenty
of light and air, and no smells. We met Countess Pahlen
going out as we came in, also the Arch Duke Charles
Louis.</p>

<p>As we still had time before dinner we went to see the
new church of St. Sauveur, where there is to be a great
ceremony of consecration to-morrow; but as it is principally
to celebrate the retreat of the French Army from
Moscow the two French Embassies abstain from that
function. We met there Prince Dolgourouky, Governor
of Moscow, who did the honours, and showed us the
marbles, which are very varied and handsome, all from
the provinces of the Empire. The place was full of workmen
putting up tribunes, red and gold draperies, etc.,
but the Prince, with much tact, made no allusion to to-morrow's
function&mdash;so we apparently didn't notice anything
unusual in the church, and concentrated our attention
on the beautiful Russian marble.</p>

<p class="author">11 o'clock.</p>

<p>I will finish to-night. We have had our second diplomatic
dinner, and I found it pleasant, I hope the guests
did. I had Mgr.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="r7">[7]</a></sup> Vannutelli, the Nonce, next to me. He
is charming&mdash;such an easy talker. He arrived after the
sacre, as of course he could take no part in the ceremony.
He told me the dream of his life was to come to
Paris, and I think he would have a great success. He
and Prince Orloff talked very easily together, and Orloff
told him he ought to come to Paris. Orloff also says
that W. ought to come back here as Ambassador, that
he would be decidedly a "persona grata," but that isn't
W.'s impression. He has talked to a good many men
who are about the Court and the Emperor, and he thinks
a soldier, not a political man, would be a much better
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_97" title="pg 97"> </a>
appointment. We shall miss Pont&eacute;coulant awfully. He
is so easy-going and looks after everything, always
smoothing things over&mdash;very necessary in a temporary
Embassy like this where all pull apart a little, and there
is a sort of dull friction and rivalry between the soldiers
and the diplomatists. It is funny to live entirely with a
quantity of men, but they are all charming to me.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Ambassade de France, Moscow</span>,<br >
<span class="smcap">Maison Klein, Malaia Dimitrofska</span>,<br >
Thursday, June 7th, 1883.</p>

<p>W. and I have had such a quiet conjugal day that we
can hardly believe we are still "Ambassadeur Extraordinaire."
We breakfasted t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, as all the gentlemen
have gone off to the Convent of St. Serge, which is one
of the things to see here. They have a very fine tr&eacute;sor.
The Emperor and Empress made retraite there before
the sacre. After breakfast W. looked over his despatches,
and I played a little some Russian music which
Benckendorff had given me.</p>

<p>About three we started off for "les Moineaux," a hill
near Moscow from which Napoleon had his first view of
the city. There was no sun, which was a pity, as all the
colour of Moscow makes it so original and different from
everything else&mdash;however the city looked mysterious and
poetical in a sort of pink brume. We met various colleagues
going the same way&mdash;Nigra always in his
"Troika" (Russian attelage) and the Hunts. Nigra came
and joined us on the terrace, and we had tea together.
They offered us a great many things, but we declined
experiments, and kept on saying "Tchai" (which means
tea), until they brought it. Nigra told W. he should
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_98" title="pg 98"> </a>
taste the peculiar brandy of the country which all drink&mdash;prince
and peasant&mdash;but I think W. did not like it much.
Nigra was most agreeable. He is Italian Ambassador to
Petersburg, and knows everybody. He says Russian
Society is rather ferm&eacute;e, unless you take their ways and
hours. All the ladies receive late, after the theatres,
every evening. It is quite informal&mdash;a cup of tea, very
often music, and really interesting talk. He says the
women are remarkably intelligent and cultivated&mdash;en
masse cleverer than the men. I wonder if he would go
as far about them as Lord Lyons did about American
women. When he came back from America he said he
had <em>never</em> met a stupid American woman. We had a
pleasant hour on the terrace, and then started home
again.</p>

<p>We crossed the Empress driving with her brother,
Prince Waldemar, in an ordinary open carriage (harnessed
Russian fashion&mdash;the three horses) and with no
escort nor <em>apparent</em> policemen of any kind. She looked
very well and smiling, and so young. There was not
much movement on the road&mdash;a few carriages and peasant's
carts. As soon as we got into Moscow we fell at
once into the same staring, quiet crowd; but I fancy
many people have already gone. The streets were not
nearly so full.</p>

<p>I had just time to dress, and dined alone with the
gentlemen. W. and G&eacute;n&eacute;ral Pitti&eacute; dined with the Nonce,
Mgr. Vannutelli, and were to go to Countess Pahlen's
reception afterwards. The expedition to the Convent
seems to have been very successful, but long. They gave
them breakfast in the refectory&mdash;a very frugal meal&mdash;and
showed them all their treasures. I stayed a little
while in the serre while they were smoking. Now they
have all gone out and I am not sorry to finish my evening
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_99" title="pg 99"> </a>
quietly in my little boudoir. I am getting quite accustomed
to my little room, with its ugly green and gold
silk furniture (quite hideous, such a bright, hard green).
The chairs and sofa are so heavy it takes two of us to
move them. There are quantities of tables and candles
(40 or 50 at least, no lamps of any description), in
branches, double candlesticks, etc. I have great difficulty
in persuading the little Russian maid not to light
them all, all the time; and when I have about 12 to dress
by she evidently considers me in the dark absolutely. I
<em>think</em> I have dressed sometimes with two, quite contented,
in the old days.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, June 8th.</p>

<p>I walked about a little with Corcelle this morning.
We went into one fur shop where we found a woman
who spoke French, but there was nothing very tempting.
They all advise us to wait for our furs at Petersburg, all
the best furs are sent there&mdash;however we bought a very
good fur lining for a driving coat (each of us) and I a
fur couverture&mdash;principally I think because the woman
was nice, and it was a pleasure to talk ourselves and not
through the little boy of the Consulate, of whom I am by
no means sure.</p>

<p>At 10 o'clock W. had his farewell audience with the
Emperor, but it wasn't particularly interesting&mdash;an insignificant
conversation&mdash;might have been any emperor,
or any ambassador, of any country.</p>

<p>After breakfast we went out again "en bande" with a
new polyglot youth this time&mdash;a young Frenchman whom
Lhermite had discovered. He took us to all sorts of
places, small shops and bazaars, where we had never
been. We bought a good many things, Circassian belts
and buckles of wrought silver, some studded with turquoises,
some enamelled&mdash;pretty work&mdash;Russian chains
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_100" title="pg 100"> </a>
and crosses, small Madonnas in curious brass frames&mdash;always
the black face on a gold ground, and
several of those beautiful, light Orenburg shawls, so fine
that they pass through a ring (we all tried) and yet fairly
large and warm when one shakes them out to the full
size. It was rather amusing going in and out of all the
funny little shops. We left the carriage in one of the
big streets and walked about.</p>

<p>Now we have come home. I have had my tea alone
to-day. I must dress, as we dine early, 7 o'clock, on
account of our reception afterwards. I went with Lhermite
to see the flowers, fruit, bonbons, petits fours, etc.,
which arrived this morning from Paris. It is extraordinary
how fresh they all look. There are dozens of
boxes in the dining-room and office, and the men are
putting the flowers all about the rooms, Lhermite superintending
the whole thing. He is an enormous help&mdash;I
don't know what we should have done without him.</p>

<p>I am going to wear my white and silver brocade to-night,
the one I wore at the Palace gala dinner&mdash;my last
<em>full dress</em> in Moscow. I am rather shaken by my outing
this afternoon&mdash;the going in some of those crooked little
old streets was something awful. The holes in the so-called
pavement were appalling, and the paving-stones
tapered off generally to a sharp point. I think nothing
but a Russian carriage, driven by a Russian coachman
could have got along. I must say it is a straggling,
queer-looking town once you get out of the Kremlin
and the main streets. The houses are very far apart,
generally white and low, with large gardens, like a big
overgrown village.</p>

<p class="tb">&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, Dear, our reception is over. It is ended early,
as everything does here&mdash;and as I am wide awake I will
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_101" title="pg 101"> </a>
write at once. People began to come about 9.30, and
at 11.30 everyone had gone. The rooms looked well,
quantities of lights and flowers, everyone noticed the
flowers (there are so few here), which were heaped up
everywhere on consoles, mantelpieces, wherever one
could put them. We had a great many people&mdash;all our
colleagues in full force, but not so many Russians as we
expected. A good many were de service at the Palace,
where there was a function of some kind for Russians only
(the provinces), and I am sure many never received their
invitations, as it is impossible to find out where anyone
lives. I had a talk with General Richter and one or two
others, and then some of the younger members of the
party suggested dancing&mdash;of course we had no music, as
dancing had not been contemplated, but various amateurs
offered their services, and they had about half an hour
of waltzes. At the end they danced a little the Russian
mazurka, which I was very curious to see. It is quite
different from our cotillon or the Sir Roger de Coverley.
There are all sorts of steps and figures. The gentleman
takes his partner by the hand, holding it rather high (as
in the polonaise). They hold themselves very straight,
heads well back, as in a minuet, and do various figures.
The women have a quick, sliding step when they change
partners, which is very effective. I should think none
but Russians would dance it well&mdash;one must be born
to it.</p>

<p>Prince Orloff stayed on a little after everyone had
gone, and we talked over all the f&ecirc;tes, and principally
our own performances. He says he has heard plenty of
talk and criticisms of everything, and is much pleased
with the success of our Mission. I hope the people at
home will be satisfied.</p>

<p>We had a dinner for all the French newspaper correspondents
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_102" title="pg 102"> </a>
the other day&mdash;and they expressed themselves
as quite gratified. They told us that one of the correspondents
(I forget which paper) had accepted W.'s
invitation, but the very day of the dinner there had been
such a violent attack on W. in his paper that he didn't
like to come, and sent an excuse. They say the
Times' account is the best&mdash;the Figaro also very good
(Wolff).</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, June 9, 1883.</p>

<p>The court is most amusing this morning&mdash;all the
gentlemen are trying their horses, superintending the
saddling, etc., as most of them follow the Emperor to-day
at the revue. The little Russian horses look very lively
and never stand still an instant. W. and I go together
in the d'Orsay, Corcelle preceding us in another carriage.
Benckendorff rides with all the others. G&eacute;n&eacute;ral
Pitti&eacute; is rather bored, he hates riding, particularly on a
horse he doesn't know, so he and Fayet will only mount
at the Champ de Mars. They say the Emperor's suite
will be enormous&mdash;over 100. I wore my &eacute;cru batiste
with the heavy white embroidery and the &eacute;cru bonnet
with the wreath of pink and red roses. It is almost
white. (I wonder how I shall ever wear out all these
garments.)</p>

<p>The day is beautiful. We started about 10, as we were
invited for 11 to the Tribune Imp&eacute;riale. The road out
was a sight&mdash;the middle alley had been kept for the
swells and Court, and there were quantities of Imperial
and Ambassadors' carriages, aides-de-camp, etc., dashing
about. I didn't see any handsome <em>private</em> equipages.
They told me the reason was that the swells were attached
to the Court and went about always in Court
carriages. Our gentlemen passed us riding&mdash;they had
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_103" title="pg 103"> </a>
rendezvous in the court-yard of the Palace Petrofski,
where the Emperor mounted. We went on to the Tribune.
The cort&eacute;ge started fairly punctually. First
came the Empress in a victoria with four white horses.
The Arch Duchess Charles Louis was seated next to her,
and on the box the Duchesse d'Edimbourg and the Grand
Duchess Wladimir, I think&mdash;at any rate another Princess.
There were 2 postilions, 2 mounted grooms, and
a piqueur. Then came the Emperor riding on the right
of the Empress's carriage, always on his little grey Cossack
horse, the Grand Duke H&eacute;ritier and the Duke of
Edinburgh directly behind him, and then a long, glittering
suite of foreign Princes and officers. The Grand Duke
Wladimir commands the Gardes, and was on the field to
receive his brother. It is the first time I have seen the
Emperor without the Grand Duke Wladimir close behind
him. It was striking to see the stern, watchful face
always there. The Empress drove up and down the
lines, the Emperor riding alongside. It was difficult to
distinguish any uniforms, as they were rather far off, and
there were clouds of dust. As soon as the Empress had
passed her revue she came up to the Tribune and took up
her position directly in front, <em>standing</em> almost all the time.
The Emperor and his staff remained directly under the
Tribune to see the d&eacute;fil&eacute;. That of course was long&mdash;but
we had breakfast, also a sort of go&ucirc;ter always going on,
and servants appearing at intervals carrying trays with
tea, chocolate, orangeade, etc. All the Grand Duchesses
(not the Empress) moved about and talked to us. The
Duchesse d'Oldenburg sat down next me for some time
and told me about some of the regiments (Crimean
fame), named some of the generals, etc.</p>

<p>I had tea with the Duchess of Edinburgh. She is easy,
clever, and was much interested in all that was going on,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_104" title="pg 104"> </a>
told me I must come to the front for the cavalry and Cossack
charge, and that it would be soon. I followed her
when she made the move&mdash;the infantry were just finishing&mdash;and
in the distance one saw a movement and a flash
of lances in the sun, which showed that the Cossacks were
getting ready. They passed like a whirlwind&mdash;so fast,
and in such clouds of dust that one saw nothing but the
glint of the lances, neither colour of uniforms, horses,
flags. All the troops, infantry as well as cavalry, saluted
the Emperor as they passed&mdash;a sort of dull sound, more
like a groan than a cheer&mdash;nothing like a ringing English
hurrah.</p>

<p>That was the end, so I went to the Princess Kotchoubey,
Grande Ma&icirc;tresse, to ask her if I should go and
take leave of the Empress, as she and the Emperor leave
Moscow to-morrow. She said the Empress wished us
all, Ambassadrices and femmes de chefs-de-Mission, to
stand near the door, and she would say good-bye to us
on her way out, so we moved down, and after waiting
a little she came. She made her circle very prettily,
shook hands with all, and talked a little, but she was evidently
tired and anxious to get away. She was dressed
in a curious dress, a sort of yellow cloth of gold, and gold
bonnet with red flowers&mdash;always her splendid pearl necklace.</p>

<p>We had to wait some little time before our carriages
could get up, so I went back to the front of the Tribune
to see the troops disperse. It was a pretty sight
as they all filed off in long columns, music playing and
flags flying, and always little groups of Cossacks tearing
all over the place. I had another cup of tea with a very
good little cake while I was waiting. Lady Thornton
was tired and wanted one, so we sat there quite quietly
and had our tea. It was a lovely, bright, warm day, and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_105" title="pg 105"> </a>
we liked that better than waiting at the door in the
crowd until our carriages came.</p>

<p>We got back to the Embassy for breakfast, but were
not very hungry. We breakfasted alone with Corcelle,
as the other gentlemen breakfasted with all the Emperor's
suite at the Petrofski Palace. I am writing this
by fits and starts, as you will perceive. I began at 9 this
morning, and am finishing now at 10.30, after a pleasant
dinner at the Jaur&egrave;s&mdash;merely our two Embassies,
everyone telling his experiences, amusing enough. The
Jaur&egrave;s are quite ready to go. He wants to go to
sea again, and will command the Mediterranean Squadron,
and she is tired of Russia. I have no idea who will
succeed them, but as long as it isn't W. I don't much
care.</p>

<p>Well, our f&ecirc;tes are over. We shall have two days to
see Moscow quietly, and then break up. It has certainly
been most interesting, and now that it is over, and
we all have still our heads on our shoulders, I am very
glad we came, for I shall never see such a sight again.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, June 10th.</p>

<p>Richard and I made an ineffectual attempt to go to the
English church this morning, but after driving half over
Moscow and going to various wrong addresses, which
had been given to us, we gave it up, and came home
rather mortified and well jibed at by the whole Embassy.
Just as we were going to breakfast Prince Ourousoff, one
of the Chamberlains, appeared to say that two special
trains would start for Petersburg on Monday and Wednesday
to take back the Corps Diplomatique, and asked
us which day would suit us best. W. preferred Wednesday.
W. must have a day or two to send off horses,
carriages, huissiers, cooks, etc., and also to see a little of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_106" title="pg 106"> </a>
Moscow, for he has scarcely seen anything. All his days
were so taken up with the visits&mdash;those he made and
those he received&mdash;and his despatches, that he did little
but his morning ride on his funny little bay horse (which
he liked very much and which carried him well).</p>

<p>This afternoon we have been sight-seeing with Benckendorff,
first to the Kremlin to see the private apartments
of the Emperor and Empress. The Court, with
all the foreign Princes and their suites, left last night
after the revue, and already one sees the difference in the
streets. The crowd of peasants has disappeared, there are
fewer carriages, flags and draperies are being removed
from all the buildings, and the circulation is so easy that
one can scarcely realize that only yesterday that brilliant
throng was making its way with difficulty through the
long, straight all&eacute;e to the Champ de Mars. It is very
warm, the sun blazing, and the white dust very trying;
however we went about a good deal. We saw the Romanoff
house, an ordinary boyar house, with low, dark
rooms and a funny little winding staircase, but it had
evidently been quite done up (in the style of the epoch
of course), and I didn't find it very interesting.</p>

<p>We went into numerous churches and towers, and
wound up with a visit to the Monast&egrave;re Siminoff, from
where there is a splendid view over the city. We saw
the Director, who came out and showed us everything.
We dined quietly at home with the Embassy only. After
dinner, when smoking in the serre, the soldiers began
talking, fighting their battles over again&mdash;all that horrible
time between the Commune and Versailles, where
one of our Embassy, Fayet, was wounded. It is always
interesting when they talk seriously like that, but, Heavens,
how they shot people at the end, it makes one shiver.</p>

<p>To-morrow will be a busy day, as all the packing must
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_107" title="pg 107"> </a>
be done. One of the French couturi&egrave;res here will send a
packer, and will come herself to help the maids. Lhermite,
with his cooks, footmen, etc., start Wednesday
morning early. They must cook us our last dinner Tuesday
night. Hubert, too, with carriages, horses, etc.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Ambassade de France &agrave; Moscow</span>,<br >
<span class="smcap">Maison Klein, Malaia Dimitrofska</span>,<br >
Monday, June 11th, 1883.</p>

<p>Well, Dear, this is my last letter from Moscow&mdash;you
will certainly never again have any letter from Maison
Klein, Malaia Dimitrofska, and I suppose I shall never
see Moscow again. The court is again most lively (it
is certainly an unfailing interest to me, and I am always
looking out of the window). Someone has come from
one of the Grand Dukes, Michel, I think, to see the big
horses. Hawes was very anxious we should sell them in
Russia, if we could get a fair price. They have always
excited much attention and admiration, but they are very
big, and here the Russians are accustomed to a much
smaller race, prefer three small ones to one larger pair.
I don't know either if they could stand the climate.
There seems to be a perfect army of helpers packing carriages,
saddles, harness, and all the stable equipment.
Mdme. Gille (my couturi&egrave;re) has arrived. She has made
me a very nice little blue foulard shirt, I couldn't stand
my cloth body these hot days, and yet must travel in
that dress, as I have no other. When I think of the
furs that have always remained at the bottom of one of
the trunks&mdash;so many people told me that it would be
impossible to be in Russia in May and June without
furs. It is fair to say that Mdme. Jaur&egrave;s told me it was
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_108" title="pg 108"> </a>
freezing still the morning they left Petersburg&mdash;which
seems incredible now. I send back all my big trunks
and swell garments with the Huberts. I shall keep out
only one or two dinner dresses for Petersburg. Poor
Mdme. Hubert is rather sad at leaving me, and going
back to France without having seen Petersburg, but of
course I don't want two maids any longer.</p>

<p>This afternoon I went out with Richard for some last
shopping. The city is completely changed&mdash;not a
creature nor a carriage, nor servants in livery, nothing
but a deserted city. We met the Austrian Ambassador
walking about in a blue flannel vest and a pot hat. The
courts of the Kremlin were m&eacute;connaissables, not a soul,
hardly a soldier&mdash;one or two small detachments of Cossacks
at the gates. It is an extraordinary change in such
a short time. It has become a sleepy little provincial
town.</p>

<p>We had two or three gentlemen to dinner, M. d'Orval,
ancien officier de Chasseurs, just back from a tour in
the Caucasus with the Duc de Chartres, and a Russian
merchant for whom Richard had letters&mdash;the first person
I have seen in Russia who was neither noble nor
peasant. Both men were interesting enough. The Russian
talked prudently, but fairly openly&mdash;said there must
be a great change&mdash;things couldn't go on as they did
now, there was a young generation to be reckoned with,
active, educated, intelligent, and they must have their
say&mdash;that when the uprising came there would be a
Revolution such as Europe had never seen. I wonder.</p>

<p>After dinner we went to the Hermitage, the great public
gardens. They are pretty enough, large, with trees
and bosquets, and every variety of amusement&mdash;theatres,
concerts, dancing, and even conjurors. Some shepherds
from the Wladimir Government with long yellow
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_109" title="pg 109"> </a>
cloaks and high hats were playing a sort of reed pipe,
curious enough. At last I heard some of the Russian
national songs&mdash;a quartette was singing them in one
of the theatres. They are very pretty, monotonous, with
an undercurrent of sadness. They sang very true, and
the voices are rich, not at all the thin, high northern
voice that one expected to hear. We stayed there so
long, looking at the various things, that we didn't get
home until 12.30&mdash;much the latest entertainment I have
been to in Moscow, except the Palace ball, where the
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original text read 'suppper'">supper</ins> of course prolonged the festivities.</p>

<p class="author">Monday, June 11th.</p>

<p>It was so warm to-day and I had so much to do with
the trunks&mdash;separating the things&mdash;that I only went out
after tea, and of course did a little more shopping. I
wanted some photographs and also some music&mdash;however
Benckendorff said he would see about that for me.
We dined quite alone with the Embassy&mdash;a good dinner
perfectly served, tho' Lhermite leaves to-morrow.
He came up to get his last instructions from W. while
we were having tea. His experiences are most amusing&mdash;he
says he has learnt a great deal of the language and
the Russian ways of doing business, and if ever he comes
back he will know how to take care of himself. He became
quite excited at remembering various occasions
when he had been "roul&eacute;."</p>

<p>After dinner W. and I went for a last drive, to look
at the Kremlin by moonlight&mdash;and beautiful it was&mdash;the
sky was so blue one could almost see it like the Italian
summer sky, and all the great white buildings and towers
stood out gloriously. The great church of St. Basile
was extraordinary. The colours, pink, green, red, yellow,
all so vivid that even at night one quite made them out.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_110" title="pg 110"> </a>
It is a mass of towers, domes, and cupolas, every one
different in shape, work, and colour. It was planned and
executed by an Italian architect, and the story is that the
Czar (of the epoch) was so pleased, and at the same
time so afraid he might make another like it, that he had
his eyes put out. It was curiously dark and quiet inside&mdash;scarcely
any light; here and there a glimmer high
up in one of the Palace rooms. We met two or three
carriages with colleagues driving about in the moonlight
like ourselves. The river, too, looked beautiful from the
terrace&mdash;a broad silver band with moonlight full upon it.
I took a last look at the black
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original text read 'Madonnna'">Madonna</ins> in the gateway,
and the little guard of Cossacks. I shall often think
of that last night in the Kremlin when I have returned
to civilization and modern life.</p>

<p>I will send this off by to-morrow's courier. My next
letter will be from Petersburg. My little boudoir still
looks very nice. The little Russian maid is rather sad,
and has been in and out 20 times, lighting candles, opening
and shutting doors and windows, and keeping up a
stream of conversation which I can't possibly understand,
though the maids say they do. W. is deep in last despatches,
and has departed to his own quarters. I
haven't learnt any Russian, which I think is rather weak
on my part. I thought I would have some lessons at
first, but I don't think I could have learnt much in two
weeks. Lagren&eacute; was discouraging&mdash;says he knows very
little, and his mother is a Russian.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Hotel Demouth, Petersburg</span>,<br >
Jeudi, 14 Juin, 1883.</p>

<p>We arrived here last night at 12.30. The journey was
comfortable enough, but long&mdash;the Russian trains do
not go a terrifying pace. We left Moscow at 9.30, and
the Maison Klein a little before 9. The d&eacute;part was
quite imposing&mdash;all the personnel drawn up at the foot
of the stairs, Lhermite and the three coachmen outside
at the door, and a regiment of understrappers of all
kinds. The little Russian maid was weeping and kissing
my skirts. The faithful Benckendorff accompanied us to
the station and saw us safely deposited in our wagon-salon&mdash;each
Ambassador had one and a smaller one for
the suite. Two Chamberlains, not attired in velvet and
gold lace this time,&mdash;I felt rather aggrieved at having
ordinary mortals in plain clothes to look after us&mdash;were
waiting at the station to see that everything was well
done, and they went with us to Petersburg. There was
a Mongole at the door of our wagon who appeared at
intervals with tea, oranges, and much information of all
kinds (in Russian). We had all our meals en route&mdash;breakfast
at 11, dinner at 4.30, a nondescript sort of
meal, half go&ucirc;ter, half supper, with cold fish, fowl, mayonnaise,
etc., at 8&mdash;and a very pretty little tea at 10.30.
We all partook of every meal&mdash;how we managed to eat chicken and
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original text read 'mayonnaaise'">mayonnaise</ins> at 8, having dined at 4.30,
seems a mystery, but we did.</p>

<p>It was very hot at starting&mdash;the sun pouring down on
the plains that are around Moscow&mdash;not an atom of
shade, but there was a sharp shower about 2 which cooled
the air. They tell us Petersburg too is very hot. The
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_112" title="pg 112"> </a>
day passed quickly enough. Many of our colleagues
came and paid us visits. The Nuncio sat a long time.
He is most interesting, with that delightful, simple, easy
Italian manner. He asked us a great deal about the religious
ceremony the day of the Coronation. He had
only arrived after that. He is very clever and sympathetic,
ready to talk about anything, and so moderate
in his views. I think he would have a great success in
Paris, where people love to discuss and analyze everything.</p>

<p>Our Spanish colleague also came and sat with us. It
seems he wanted W. to come to his carriage and drink
champagne and play cards (very high play too), but it
was conveyed to him that these were not exactly M.
Waddington's tastes. Rumour says he was naively surprised,
and said, "Comment, il ne joue pas!&mdash;le pauvre
homme!" They were certainly a very merry party&mdash;we
heard roars of laughter every time the train stopped.
If anyone was losing heavily he took it most cheerfully.</p>

<p>Our last little tea at 10.30 was really very pretty&mdash;several
round tables very well arranged with flowers, tea,
orangeade, and other drinks&mdash;cakes, petits fours, etc.
(but no more solid food). W. struck and wouldn't get
out, but Richard and I and the rest of the men were quite
ready to see what was going on. Do you remember
how I always loved getting out at all the buffets at no
matter what time of night, when we used to go down to
Italy every year? I think the buffet at Bologna with
its "fricandeau de veau" is one of my most interesting
souvenirs of travel (not from an artistic point of view).</p>

<p>The arrival at Petersburg was curious. It was quite
light, and there were as many people at the station and
in the streets as if it were 12 o'clock in the day. We read
distinctly the names and numbers of the streets and the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_113" title="pg 113"> </a>
signs of the shops, and yet it wasn't altogether daylight&mdash;more
like a late summer afternoon. We found very
comfortable rooms here&mdash;a large salon with large bedrooms
on either side, and a room next to me for Adela&iuml;de.
I was quite ready to go to bed&mdash;the heat and dust
were trying, and yet it seemed funny to go to bed by
daylight. They brought tea of course, but we really
couldn't do any more, so I departed to my own room.
There I quite lost the impression of daylight, as there
were double, even triple curtains to all the windows.</p>

<p>This morning we slept late and breakfasted at 12.30,
then W., Richard, and I went off in a carriage to the
Hermitage (the great Museum). W. sent in his card to
the Director of the Museum and also to the head of the
Cabinet des M&eacute;dailles, as he wants a week's work at the
medals. It seems there is a splendid collection here.
The gentlemen were very civil, and we made rendezvous
for to-morrow, W. for the medals and Richard and I for
the pictures. The Hermitage is an immense museum.
We shall only be able to have an idea of what is in it.
We walked through some of the rooms&mdash;Peter the
Great's gallery, which is full of course of souvenirs&mdash;his
clothes, arms, tools, furniture, horse stuffed, etc., and in
another there were quantities of bibelots of all kinds, and
presents given to Peter and Catherine II&mdash;a collection of
snuff boxes, crystal flagons, and goblets (some with
precious stones encrusted in the glass), jewelled belts and
caps&mdash;most interesting.</p>

<p>We had our first view of the Neva from the windows of
one of the rooms. It rushes past like the sea, so broad
and strong, with very fair waves, a splendid river. We
stayed about an hour lounging through the rooms, and
then went on for a general view of the city. It is very
handsome, but has no particular cachet (except the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_114" title="pg 114"> </a>
Neva) at this season of the year&mdash;one ought to see it in
winter when the river is frozen and the real winter life begins.
It looks so modern after Moscow. We went to
the great cathedral of St. Isaac. It is very big and imposing
as a mass, but the architecture not very striking&mdash;afterwards
to the fortress and church of St. Peter and
St. Paul, where all the Emperors are buried&mdash;to Peter
the Great's house (a most ordinary little wooden building),
drove a little along the quais, where the lovely fresh
breeze from the river was most welcome and invigorating
after the heat and dust of Moscow.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of life on the river, boats of all
kinds. We think of going by steamer to Stockholm,
all along the coast of Finland. They tell us it is a beautiful
journey, particularly at this time of year, with the
long, clear evenings. I want to see the boat before we
decide, as I have an idea that it wouldn't be very clean
(they say the boats on the rivers Volga, etc., are something
terrible). We wound up in the Perspective
Nevsky&mdash;the great shopping street, but didn't get out
of the carriage, merely drove through. The shops look
handsome and the vitrines well arranged, just like Paris.
There was very little animation in the streets and very
few carriages. They tell us many people have already
gone away for the summer.</p>

<p>We dined quietly at the hotel, and just as we were
finishing Admiral Jaur&egrave;s came in to suggest that we
should dine at Peterhof to-morrow afternoon. He says
it is a very nice excursion&mdash;a short hour on the boat, and
we can get a fair dinner there. About 9.30 we started
again in the carriage to drive to the Islands or "La
Pointe"&mdash;the great rendezvous in summer of all Petersburg.
It is a long hour's drive, crossing quantities of
small islands all connected by bridges, and one finally
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_115" title="pg 115"> </a>
arrives at the "Pointe," end of the drive, and entrance of
the Gulf of Finland. There all the carriages draw up,
the people get down and walk about, or sit on the
benches at the water's edge&mdash;a regular salon&mdash;in summer
one sees all the people who are still "en ville" there.
The place in itself is not at all pretty. The water of the
Gulf is grey, the banks low, no trees&mdash;but the air was
delicious.</p>

<p>We met almost all our Moscow colleagues&mdash;also
Princess Lise Troubetzkoi, who was delighted to see W.
and plunge into Paris politics. She wanted us to go
back and have tea with her, but it was 11 o'clock and
I was tired, having been going all day&mdash;evidently that is
what people do, as several of our colleagues too asked
us, and expressed great surprise at our wanting to go
home so early.</p>

<p>We didn't get back to the hotel until 12, and then
loitered a little in the salon, as the windows were open,
people walking and driving about the streets, and
nothing to make us think it was midnight, or at least the
midnight we are accustomed to. They brought us some
tea, and a little before one, making many excuses, I retired,
rather feeling as if I were going to bed with the
chickens.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, June 15th.</p>

<p>We have been all the morning at the Hermitage, and
I will write a little now after breakfast, before we start
for Peterhof. We took ourselves off early in a droshky
(Russian fiacre), the porter telling the coachman where
to drive to; and telling us how much to give him. It
was a lovely morning, not too warm, and we enjoyed
our drive. W. was shown at once to the Cabinet des
M&eacute;dailles, where the Conservateur was waiting for him,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_116" title="pg 116"> </a>
and Richard and I were taken in hand by a young man
attached to the Museum who knew his work well, and
was remarkably intelligent, speaking French quite well.
The pictures are beautiful&mdash;there are quantities of every
possible school. The finest we thought the Van Dycks
and the Rembrandts, though some of the Italian Madonnas
were lovely too. I like the Italian Madonna face so
much&mdash;it is so pure and young and passionless. Our
guide was very talkative, and very anxious to know what
we thought of the Moscow ceremonies. We stayed
about two hours, seeing all sorts of things "en passant"
besides the pictures. The whole Museum is crowded&mdash;I
don't think they could get much more in.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, June 16th.</p>

<p>Our excursion to Peterhof was delightful yesterday
afternoon. We took the four o'clock boat, and had a
nice sail down of an hour and a quarter. The Jaur&egrave;s
came with us, also Pitti&eacute;, Fayet, and Calmon. Corcelle
went back to Paris from Moscow&mdash;also Sesmaisons,
so our Mission is decidedly diminished. We met several
of our Moscow friends on the boat&mdash;General Richter,
Comte Worontzoff, and some others. The Court is at
Peterhof and they are all established there. They told
us the Emperor and Empress were not very tired after
the excitement and emotions of the Coronation&mdash;very
happy that all had gone so smoothly, and now quite
pleased to be quietly at Peterhof with their children.</p>

<p>The Russians are very proud of Peterhof, call it a
"petit Versailles," and "petit" it certainly is in comparison;
but the park is pretty, well laid out, with terraces
and gardens, and the water-works really very good
indeed. A very good Circassian band was playing, and
a good many people walking about. What was lovely
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_117" title="pg 117"> </a>
and quite unlike Versailles were the glimpses of the sea
one had on all sides. We got carriages and drove all
about. We went into the big Palace, where the present
Emperor never lives. He prefers a small place, half farm,
half cottage, close to the sea, and lives there quite contentedly
and quietly like an ordinary country gentleman.
However we couldn't get anywhere near that villa&mdash;the
gates and alleys were closed, and guards and soldiers
everywhere.</p>

<p>We dined very badly at a restaurant we had been told
of on the sea, and took the 10 o'clock boat home. The
return was enchanting&mdash;a beautiful starlight night, and
fresh, soft breeze. I had a nice talk with Mdme. Jaur&egrave;s,
who told me a good deal of Russian ways and life. I
think she is glad to go back to France, and "au fond"
there are very few French women who care to <em>live</em>
abroad altogether. After three or four years they get
homesick for their own country. She asked me if I was
never homesick for America&mdash;but I told her I had been
so long away, and my life had been such a full one that
I sometimes asked myself was I the same little girl that
used to run wild in the country at home with a donkey
cart and a big Newfoundland dog. Those years seem so
long ago the memory is getting duller. Sometimes I
shut my eyes and see quite well the big white house with
the piazzas, and the climbing roses, the cherry trees, and
the white gate with the sharp turn, and the ditch where
we upset so often in the sleighs&mdash;all the children tumbling
out into the snow drift, and nobody minding.</p>

<p>We got home at 11.30 and found letters, which we
read quite easily at the window. It is a wonderful light&mdash;no
one ever seems to think of going to bed.</p>

<p>This morning we have been again at the Hermitage to
finish the pictures. Decidedly the Rembrandts are the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_118" title="pg 118"> </a>
gems of the collection. There was one old man in a sort
of fur robe and cap, with a wrinkled yellow face, whose
eyes seemed quite alive, and followed us all round the
room. We left W. with his medals and a sort of clerk
attached to the Cabinet des M&eacute;dailles. It seems they
never leave anybody alone in the room with the medals.
W. is delighted, he has found some rare coins he had
never seen, and he means to have a good day's work,
will not come back to breakfast with us.</p>

<p>Our young man, Baron Leeven, is always with us, and
meets us at the Winter Palace this afternoon to show us
the rooms. Our Mission is dwindling; Fayet went
off this morning, Pitti&eacute; and Calmon go Monday. Richard
remains to make the journey with us to Stockholm
by sea. We have just come in from a pleasant dinner at the
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original text read 'Juar&egrave;s'">Jaur&egrave;s</ins>'. The Embassy is small, but very
well arranged, and we had a very good, handsome dinner.
All the personnel of the Embassy, Vannutelli and
his two auditeurs, and the French Consul and his wife. Admiral
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original text read 'Juar&egrave;s'">Jaur&egrave;s</ins> was very hospitable and en train&mdash;all
sailors are, I wonder why? The officers of high rank
must have so many lonely hours, and are such swells
on their ships, where no one can associate much with
them, that one would think it would make them rather
silent and reserved from long habit&mdash;but it is quite the
contrary. In all nations sailors are generally cultivated,
and good talkers.</p>

<p>We shall become quite intimate with Vannutelli. We
met him at the Winter Palace this afternoon, and went
all about together. I can't say I found it very interesting.
The rooms are handsome&mdash;high, generally white,
with quantities of pictures&mdash;the portraits, some very old
ones, interesting&mdash;the large modern pictures of battles
by sea and land less so. I like very much the pictures of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_119" title="pg 119"> </a>
Peter the Great. He has a keen, striking face, must have
had splendid eyes, very intelligent, in some of the portraits
almost inspired, <em>hard</em>, not cruel. They were very
anxious to show us the rooms where the late Emperor
died, but there had been some mistake, and the man who
has charge of the room could not be found, nor the key
either. I was very glad (not that I should have gone
in), for they said it was a horrid sight&mdash;the camp-bed
and even his clothes left as they were, thick with blood.
He was carried there directly after the attentat, and died
on the little camp-bed. What I liked best was the splendid
view again of the Neva from the windows of the ballroom.
It looked a beautiful blue sea, the waves dancing
in the afternoon light, and all the white sails standing out
well in the sun. The two young men who were with us
were most amusing. They showed us all the pictures in
detail <em>except</em> those concerning the Grande Arm&eacute;e and the
disastrous retreat. We were hurried past them, "rien de
tr&egrave;s int&eacute;ressant, Madame&mdash;pas la peine de s'arr&ecirc;ter&mdash;&mdash;."</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, June 17th.</p>

<p>This morning we went to the French Protestant
Church&mdash;a large room with white walls, and benches.
There were very few people, but they tell us it is fairly
full in winter. There is a large French colony&mdash;shopkeepers,
theatre people, etc., and a great many Protestants.
The Pasteur preached a very fair, sensible sermon.</p>

<p>After breakfast we had some visitors&mdash;Sir Edward
Thornton, who wants us to dine one night; and a nice
man, a Russian (whose name I never knew), but who
told us to come to this hotel in which he is interested,
and who has offered to go shopping with us one day,
and show us the best fur-shops. We went for a drive
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_120" title="pg 120"> </a>
in the afternoon to the Park Catherine, where a sort of
f&ecirc;te populaire was going on. There were a great many
people, and a great many policemen (as there always are
here), one would think they lived in perpetual fear of an
&eacute;meute, and yet the people all looked so subdued and repressed&mdash;I
haven't seen one fierce face. The quantity
of moujiks in their red shirts made a good effect of
colour, but the women are not attractive, nor pretty.
All are wrapped up in shawls, with a handkerchief over
their heads.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant dinner at the Hunts' (United States
Legation), all their people, including of course George
Wurts, whom I was very pleased to see again&mdash;Admiral
Baldwin and his two Aides-de-camp Rogers and Paul,
and M. et Mdme. de Struve. They are just going to
America&mdash;he is named Minister there. They have been
in Japan, and didn't seem very keen about America. I
should think they would like it better than Japan, but I
believe he hoped for some post in Europe. She was
very amusing, and from her account life in Japan must
still be very primitive.</p>

<p>We came away early&mdash;about 10.30&mdash;and have been
poring over guide-books ever since, making out our
journey, always at the window (11 o'clock at night, and
with no lamps).</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, June 19th.</p>

<p>We had a charming afternoon yesterday at Cronstadt
on the Lancaster, Admiral Baldwin's flag-ship. He had
invited all the Corps Diplomatique, and the few Russians
who are still in Petersburg, Jomini, Struve, Benckendorff,
etc. We started about 3.30 in the regular Russian
steamer, and once under way the breeze was delicious.
I wore my white batiste with Valenciennes, and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_121" title="pg 121"> </a>
a big black hat (which wasn't very practical on the
steamer, as the wind blew the feathers about considerably,
but I thought it looked so nice with the white
dress). The American ship looked beautiful as we drew
near&mdash;an old-fashioned frigate, all dressed with flags.
The getting on board was not very easy, as she lay far
out, and we had to get into small boats from our
steamer and go out to her. It didn't look very pleasant
when they put the steps down and told us to jump.
There were fair waves, and when they told us to jump
the boat was apparently nowhere near, but of course
swung under the steps on the top of the wave at the
right moment. Lady Thornton got down all right, so
did I; but one of our colleagues had a most trying time.
She was stout and nervous, looked wretched when she
was standing on the steps between two strong sailors
who told her to jump. She did her best, poor thing, and
several times we in the boat below saw a stout white leg
suddenly descend, but it was immediately drawn back,
and she never let go of her sailors. Her husband, man-like,
was furious, which of course made her much more
nervous; however, after several attempts she gave it up,
and they lowered her in an arm-chair, which didn't look
quite comfortable either when it was suspended in the
air waiting for the boat to arrive.</p>

<p>We danced about well in the little boat, for every time
it came up, and she didn't come down, we had to go back
and repeat the performance. The American Legation
got off first and were received by a salute of 15 guns, and
then we followed. The Admiral with all his officers received
us at the top of the ladder, and the band played
our national airs, and they gave the Ambassador's salute,
17 guns, and a great noise it made just over our heads
as we were mounting the ladder. Lady Thornton and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_122" title="pg 122"> </a>
her husband were in front of me, and I heard the "God
Save The Queen"&mdash;then came the "Marseillaise," and
for a moment I forgot I was a Frenchwoman and looked
to see whom the "Marseillaise" was for (W. hadn't come
in the boat with me, waited for the second one), but I
recovered myself in time to bow and smile my thanks.</p>

<p>I was delighted to find myself on an American ship,
I so rarely see American officers of any kind. The ship
was in splendid condition, so beautifully clean. We had
a very handsome dinner in the Admiral's cabin. He
took me down to see the table before all the guests came,
and very pretty it looked, quantities of flowers and some
handsome silver. No one enjoyed the day more than
Mgr. Vannutelli. He had a little doubt about coming,
as he heard there was to be dancing, and consulted us
about it. We told him the dancing would be mild, and
he might never have a chance to see a big American
ship again, and strongly advised him to come.</p>

<p>While Lady Thornton and I were sitting together one
of the young officers came up to her (she knew several
of them, as they were some years in Washington) saying
he heard one of the Ambassadresses was an American,
did she know which one, and could she introduce him.
"Certainly," she said, "it is Madame Waddington, wife
of the French Ambassador, who is sitting next to me
now," and immediately presented the young man, who
said he had been looking at all the ladies to see which
was the American, but hadn't placed me, he supposed
because he heard me speaking French. We became
great friends, and he took me all over the ship. We
danced a little on deck&mdash;a quadrille d'honneur&mdash;I with
my friend Schimmelpenninck, Lady Thornton with
Jaur&egrave;s, Madame Jaur&egrave;s with Admiral Baldwin. Then we
left the dancing to the young ones and sat quietly on
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_123" title="pg 123"> </a>
deck till it was time to go. Just as we were starting the
Admiral asked me if I would say a few words to the band&mdash;they
were almost all Italians. I went over at once and
talked to them, so did the Nuncio, which of course delighted
them.</p>

<p>We started back about 9 in a special Russian steamer.
The sea was much calmer, and the getting off one boat
and on another was not such a difficult operation even
for poor Mdme. A&mdash;&mdash;. The sail back was about two
hours&mdash;quite enchanting in that beautiful northern twilight,
and we were all sorry when it came to an end.</p>

<p>This morning it is very warm, and I am rather seedy,
so I have stayed quietly at home. Richard and I breakfasted
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, as W. was off at an early hour to his
medals, and won't be back until dark. I wonder if the
Russian officials will be as astonished at his capacity for
a long spell of work as the Italians were. <em>They</em> struck
after <em>two</em> days of such work, and then took it in turns.
One day at Milan I went to get him at the end of the
day, as we were going to drive somewhere in the country,
so the Italian smiled all over, and almost winked, saying,
"Ah, Madame est venue voir si Monsieur &eacute;tait vraiment
aux M&eacute;dailles toute la journ&eacute;e." I suppose he felt that
he wouldn't have stayed working all those hours, and
also quite understood that I suspected W. of doing
something else.</p>

<p>We have had a nice visit from Benckendorff, who has
told us all about the boat we want to take to go to
Stockholm. He says they are Swedish boats, very clean,
and very good food; also very few people at this time
of the year.</p>

<p>Now I must dress and go with Richard to pay some
visits. Calmon will go and see you and give you all our
news. He won't tell you what I will, that he had a great
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_124" title="pg 124"> </a>
success in Moscow&mdash;his artillery uniform, the astrakhan
tunique, was very becoming&mdash;all the ladies found him
"tr&egrave;s beau gar&ccedil;on." I must add too that Richard also
had a great success&mdash;evidently artillery uniform is becoming.
It was rather amusing to see the face of one of
the young ladies when I made some reference to Madame
Richard Waddington. "M. Waddington married&mdash;I
never should have dreamed of it"&mdash;and after a moment,
"What is his wife like?" doubtfully. "Is she pretty?"
"Well, yes, she is very pretty." Richard won't tell you
that either when he comes back, but I shall tell Louise.</p>

<p>How curious all the Moscow life will seem when I am
settled again at Bourneville&mdash;walking in the park with
the children, riding all over the country with W., and
leading an absolutely quiet life. I hope I shall remember
all I want to tell you.</p>

Wednesday, June 20th, 1883.</p>

<p>Richard and I went visiting yesterday. We found the
Thorntons, who gave us tea. Their Embassy is charming&mdash;a
big house on the Quai Anglais. The drawing-rooms
are large and high. All the windows look out
on the Neva, and they say it is quite beautiful at night.
Then we went back to the hotel, got W., who had had a
fine morning with his medals&mdash;says the collection is magnificent,
much larger than he had any idea of, and started
off to the Quais to see our boat. We leave to-morrow
evening between 6 and 7. It looked very nice and clean,
and the Captain was quite overwhelmed with the distinguished
passengers he was to have the honour of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_125" title="pg 125"> </a>
transporting. We have an enormous cabin (two thrown
into one) big enough for a family. I interviewed the
stewardess, a nice fresh-looking Norwegian woman.
Conversation was rather difficult, as I spoke German
and she Norwegian, and neither of us understood the
other, but I am sure we shall get on very well. They
tell us the voyage is enchanting, all in and out of small
fiords, islands, and narrow rivers. We stop five or six
hours each day to see the country, and never have any
sea until we cross to Stockholm, when it is generally
rough.</p>

<p>We dined quietly at the hotel with Coutouly, our
Consul, a very nice man, very intelligent. He too had
interviewed the Captain, and told him to take every care
of us. He says the trip is enchanting, and the two Finnish
towns, Helsingfors and Abo, very well worth seeing.
About 10 o'clock we drove off to the "Pointe" and had
a pleasant hour with some of the colleagues. It is always
cool there, and the drive out is interesting, so unlike
anything else.</p>

<p>Richard went off early this morning with Sermet and
Moulin of the French Embassy to see the Falls of
Smatra, which are said to be very fine. We pick him
up at Helsingfors.</p>

<p>I walked about a little with Adela&iuml;de&mdash;I never see
anything the least like a femme du monde in the streets.
I suppose the "soci&eacute;t&eacute;" are away for the summer, and
the streets look rather as September streets do in Paris.</p>

<p>W. and I dined at the Thorntons'&mdash;handsome and
pleasant. Jaur&egrave;s was there, not his wife, she has already
started for Paris, and the Ternaux Compans, a nice young
m&eacute;nage (just married) attached to the Embassy. She
was very well dressed, in white. There was also the
Danish Minister (I forget his name). He is a friend of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_126" title="pg 126"> </a>
the Empress and tr&egrave;s bien vu &agrave; la cour. After dinner
someone played on the piano, and he and Mary Thornton
danced a little, showing us some of the figures of the
mazurka. Lady Thornton says, like everyone else, that
the society of Petersburg is very ferm&eacute;. They know
everybody, but I fancy very few of the diplomatists make
real friends with anyone. I was rather surprised, as the
Russians one meets abroad are generally very easy and
sociable. She also finds the climate very trying. She
showed me all the rooms, which are charming. In all
the bedrooms very thick curtains, as the light is most
trying, and of course people who live there must have
regular hours for sleep&mdash;for us birds of passage it is of
no consequence, and going to bed seems the last thing
one would think of doing in Petersburg.</p>

<p>We came home about 11, and now W. is busy over
his Paris letters, also putting his notes in order, as he
has finished with the medals. He has had three or four
days of real hard work, but says it rested him after all the
Court festivities.</p>

<p class="author">Jeudi, 21 Juin.</p>

<p>We have been shopping all the morning,&mdash;W. and I
and M. Lomatch (I have found his name). We bought,
among other things, a sled for Francis&mdash;I haven't seen
one since I left America&mdash;and a good deal of Russian
lace, which they say is very solid, and embroidery. We
came back to a late breakfast, and I am writing now at
the last moment while they are carrying down the trunks.
We are going at 4 to the steamer to leave our boxes
and Adela&iuml;de, and install ourselves, and then go for tea
to Coutouly, who has an apartment on the Quai, just opposite
the wharf where the steamer starts from. I am
quite sorry to go. We are very comfortable here, and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_127" title="pg 127"> </a>
the streets are so amusing. I should like once to hear a
little laughing and singing, as the various groups of
work-people, soldiers, and peasants pass&mdash;but they are a
curiously sad, subdued race.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, June 22d.  "En mer."</p>

<p>We are just approaching Helsingfors (twelve o'clock),
where we go on shore for some hours, and I will write
a little. I have a nice straw arm-chair on deck (the sail
shades me), a table with books, papers, etc. We embarked
at 6.30 yesterday. We went on the boat about
4&mdash;saw the Captain, a very nice man, a Finn, who speaks
English quite well, and who is much pleased to have us
on his boat. He went down to the cabin with us, which
is really a large, airy room, with two very fair beds, and
a sort of recess which makes a dressing-room. It opens
into the ladies' cabin, where he had also arranged the end
near our cabin for us&mdash;two arm-chairs, a table, etc. Adela&iuml;de
has a nice state-room just opposite&mdash;also Richard.
There were not many people on board&mdash;and he said he
hadn't many passengers, chiefly men.</p>

<p>We left cloaks, books, etc., and walked across to the
Coutoulys', who have a nice apartment directly on the
river. It is so broad and swift one feels almost as if one
was on the sea-shore. There is much passing all the
time, and a good many little posts, as at Venice, where
the boats are tied. They gave us tea, and about 6 we
went back to the boat.</p>

<p>Jaur&egrave;s was there with some of his young men, and
Benckendorff, who came to say a last good-bye this time.
We gave him rendezvous in Paris, as we should like very
much to do something for him. He was untiring and
devoted to us all the time we were at Moscow&mdash;never
tired, always taking a great deal of trouble to see that
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_128" title="pg 128"> </a>
we were well taken care of, and helping us in every way.
I found three or four handsome bouquets in the cabin&mdash;one
from him, and one from M. Lomatch, the proprietor
of our hotel. He has written to the hotel at Stockholm
for rooms for us. We arrive Sunday morning&mdash;have
three nights at sea. Adela&iuml;de is quite excited at the
prospect of a real voyage "en mer."</p>

<p>We had a very good supper about 8.30, just as we
were passing Cronstadt. We have made a very nice
arrangement for our meals. The idea of a table-d'h&ocirc;te
with all the people who are on board (many more than
I thought) was appalling, so we are to have all our
meals half an hour before the others at a small table in
the dining-room. It is a most satisfactory arrangement,
and we had a nice quiet hour on deck while
the other passengers were supping. It was a lovely
evening&mdash;the sea absolutely calm, and so warm I hardly
needed my cloak. We sat late on deck. They brought
us a table with tea and Swedish punch, which seems to
be the favourite drink here.</p>

<p>The passengers all came up after their supper. They
were quiet enough&mdash;all had tea, punch, and cigars, and
a great many played cards. The men look like commis-voyageurs,
or small shopkeepers&mdash;almost all, I should
think, Swedes or Norwegians. There are three or four
English women and girls, governesses, the Captain tells
me, going to Stockholm and Christiania.</p>

<p>We went down to our cabin about 12&mdash;always the
same curious grey light. I slept perfectly well. It
seemed to me there was a little roulis about 3 o'clock
(I heard a clock strike somewhere), but it was only pleasant.
I was up at 8 and had my tea and toast in the
ladies' cabin close to a port-hole, and was rather sorry
I hadn't had it on deck. I went up as soon as I had
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_129" title="pg 129"> </a>
finished. We were passing through a series of little
bays, all dotted over with islands, some fairly large, some
merely a granite rock with a pine tree on it.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, June 23d. "En mer."</p>

<p>I was interrupted yesterday by the Captain, who came
to get us to stand on the passerelle with him and see the
approach to Helsingfors. The bay has widened out into
a sea, and the harbour seems important. There are lots
of ships and steamers&mdash;also small boats going backwards
and forwards between them and the quais. The men in
the boats wear a red cap, something like the Neapolitan
fishermen. The town stands out well&mdash;there are high
cliffs rising straight out of the sea, and a great many
steeples (not the green and pink cupolas of Moscow).</p>

<p>We found Richard and our Consul waiting for us on
the Quai, and we drove at once to the hotel, and breakfasted.
The steamer remains until 12 o'clock to-night,
so we have ample time to see the town. Just as we were
finishing breakfast a gentleman appeared, a director of
something (Postes et T&eacute;l&eacute;graphes, I think) who came
to do the honours in the absence of the Governor. He
had an open carriage with a pair of nice little Russian
horses, and drove us all over the town. Helsingfors is
the capital of Finland, and I believe flourishing enough.
The town is small and rambling&mdash;entirely surrounded
by water, and quantities of little islands connected by
bridges. I think we must have crossed about 20. Some
of the villas are large with nice gardens. The Director
showed us his, which looked pretty and comfortable.
The streets are narrow&mdash;not much movement. The
names of the streets are written in three languages&mdash;Russian,
Swedish, Finnish. All the functionaries are
Russian, the small merchants and shopkeepers Swedish,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_130" title="pg 130"> </a>
and the peasants and sailors Finns. They (Finns) have
a very marked type of their own, not particularly Russian,
nothing of the Tartar, only very Northern.</p>

<p>We dined at the famous Caf&eacute; du Parc. W. invited
the Director and the Consul to dine with us, and we had
a pleasant little dinner, fairly good. There was a good
orchestra, who had evidently been told who we were, for
as soon as we arrived they played the "Marseillaise" very
well. It caused quite a sensation among the people who
were dining, as they evidently hadn't noticed particularly
the quiet party which came in&mdash;all of us of course in
travelling dresses. The chef d'orchestre asked our Director
if we would like to hear some national airs&mdash;which
they played very well, and then I asked for the
Polonaise from Glinka's "La Vie pour le Czar," which
they always played in Moscow whenever the Imperial
cort&eacute;ge arrived.</p>

<p>At 11 o'clock the Consul's steam launch came (the
caf&eacute; is on the water), and he took us all about the inner
harbour, most curious and interesting, and then outside.
It was a beautiful moonlight night, and we went sometimes
so close up to one of the islands that we could have
spoken to anyone on the shore if there had been anybody
to speak to&mdash;sometimes we were in what seemed a
great lake, with no perceptible outlet. We cruised about
until midnight, then went back to the hotel, and walked
down to the steamer. The light had changed&mdash;was
rather like dawn, but perfectly light. There were people
and carriages, children, badauds, loitering about the
wharf. They told us a steamer had started two or three
hours earlier with tourists on board to see the midnight
sun.</p>

<p>We stayed on deck about half an hour to see the d&eacute;part.
The light was getting much stronger&mdash;Richard
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_131" title="pg 131"> </a>
read a letter quite easily, and at 1 o'clock, when I went
down to the cabin, the sun was shining bright. I am
writing now on deck after breakfast. Young Moltke, a
Dane, came on board last night, and asked if he might
have his meals with us. He too had been at the Coronation,
and found the standing all those hours very tiring.
The day is beautiful&mdash;the sea perfectly calm, and the
long, lazy hours on deck most resting.</p>

<p>This morning I was interviewed by two English girls&mdash;both
young and rather pretty, the fair English type.
One was a governess going back to her place, somewhere
near Stockholm, in the country; the other was just going
out on a venture, had no engagement, knew no language
but her own, and had merely made the acquaintance of
the other girl on the boat. I suggested it was rather a
risk coming so far without anything definite; but she said
she was sure she would find something, and she had a
little money. I asked her how old she was&mdash;17. "How
could your parents let you start off like that?" "Oh,
there are so many of us, and I am strong." They then
asked me if I would tell them something about the
Coronation&mdash;so I talked to them a few minutes. They
asked me if I saw many Nihilists&mdash;as if they were a
marked class&mdash;and did the Empress look nervous.</p>

<p>I have also managed to talk a little to the stewardess,
or rather to understand her&mdash;as I have made out that she
is married, and has young children, and no one apparently
to leave them with while she is cruising about.</p>

<p>I wish I could sketch, there are so many charming little
bits of scenery that I would like to bring home with
me. We are getting near Abo, and I must stop. To-night
is to be our rough night in the Baltic. At the
present moment the sea is like glass, but the Captain says
there is always movement crossing over to Stockholm.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_132" title="pg 132"> </a>
I should like to go on forever in the boat. The long,
long hours on the deck with this soft grey sea and sky,
with nobody to talk to, and no dressing of any kind are
enchanting. I have got a book, Tolstoy's "Guerre et
Paix," but I don't seem to get on much&mdash;I am always
looking at something.</p>

<p class="author">8 o'clock.</p>

<p>We have just got back after a lovely afternoon at Abo
(the old capital of Finland). The approach was very
picturesque as we went some distance up a narrow river
to the town, which is not directly on the sea. Our Vice-Consul
was waiting on the quai with a carriage, and we
drove all over the place. It is now a dead city&mdash;all the
life and interest of Finland is absorbed by Helsingfors,
but it is interesting. We saw the Cathedral, the public
gardens, and then drove some distance into the country
to see the oldest church in Finland&mdash;a little old, grey
building that looks any age. The country is very pretty,
always charming views of the sea, and a few villas dotted
about, but nothing like as many as at Helsingfors. It
seems people come sometimes in summer for sea air,
bathing, and fishing, and occasionally English yachts stop
a day or two.</p>

<p>We got back about eight, and I am writing now before
supper. We found the boat all dressed with greens, as it
is the St. Jean, and they tell us we shall see lights, bonfires,
and torches on all the little islands, as they always
celebrate the St. Jean here with greens and lights. My
next letter will be from Stockholm.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Stockholm</span>,<br >
Sunday, June 24th, 1883.</p>

<p>Well, Dear, we arrived at 12 o'clock this morning, and
I was quite sorry to leave the boat and my nice big cabin,
and the good-natured stewardess. Last night was enchanting.
We sat on deck until 12.30. W. treated us
all to Swedish punch and cakes. It was decidedly cooler&mdash;for
the first time I had on the warm, long, blue cloth
coat I started in from Paris, and there was rather more
motion. How it would amuse you&mdash;I wish you were
here. The deck looks quite picturesque&mdash;lots of little
round tables with groups of three or four people, all
drinking something, and most of them playing cards.
Between 11 and 12 there is a sort of night, or darkness,
so they brought up some lamps, which looked weird, and
gave a faint, flickering light. We run sometimes so
close to the islands, between several, in a narrow channel,
that one would think it was impossible to pass, but evidently
it is deep sea everywhere, and we go steadily on
without slackening. I am delighted we decided to come
by sea. It is again a most novel experience, and such
a contrast to our Moscow stay&mdash;all gold and glitter, and
colour and courtiers.</p>

<p>We were just getting out of the little channels and
islands and making for the open sea when I went downstairs.
The captain came and sat with us a little while,
and told us where we were. Some of the lights on the
small islands looked as if they were rising straight out
of the sea. The water was grey, and the rock grey&mdash;one
only saw the light.</p>

<p>We didn't meet many ships&mdash;a few sailing boats as we
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_134" title="pg 134"> </a>
left Abo&mdash;but no steamers or big ships. We were up
fairly early, as they told us the entrance to Stockholm
was so beautiful. Coming by water it rises straight out
of the sea like Venice. There were quantities of islands,
but much greener than those of the Finnish coast, and
the cliffs higher. Villas everywhere, close down to the
water's edge, and running up the hills. Little pleasure
boats and yachts skimming all over the harbour. As it
was f&ecirc;te St. Jean all the peasants and country people
were out in flat-bottomed boats, crowded with women
and children down to the water's edge&mdash;the boats quite
covered with green boughs and leaves, the women in
costume&mdash;a white skirt, coloured bodice embroidered in
gold or silver&mdash;silver charms and big pins in their hair.
It really was fairy-like for quite two hours before we
arrived.</p>

<p>We got in at twelve exactly, and breakfasted on
board. The river is so deep that big ships run straight
up into the town. The American frigate, Lancaster,
which arrived last night, is anchored directly in front of
the hotel, under our windows.</p>

<p>We took a most cordial leave of our Captain, who
expressed great gratification at having had us on board&mdash;hoped
we were satisfied and would recommend his
boat to any of our friends who wanted to make the same
trip. W. and Richard were astounded at the cheapness
of the journey. I think they made out it was about
50 francs apiece&mdash;tout compris. We were three nights
on board, and had all our meals except the day at
Helsingfors.</p>

<p>We found various people waiting for us at the quai&mdash;one
of the secretaries of our Legation&mdash;the g&eacute;rant of
the H&ocirc;tel de l'Europe&mdash;one or two members of the
French colony here, and M. Mathias, a French engineer
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_135" title="pg 135"> </a>
who lives here. We went across to the hotel in a ferry-boat
and found charming rooms, with windows and balconies
on the river. The proprietor informed us with
much pride that the last distinguished foreigner that had
occupied the apartment was Mdme. Sarah Bernhardt.</p>

<p>We found quantities of letters, unpacked a little&mdash;I
wasn't sorry to get out of my blue cloth into something
lighter, as it is warm. They say it is going to rain, and it
has been dull and grey all the morning. M. Paten&ocirc;tre,
French Minister, has sent word that he will come and see
us about 2.30. The King is here, and will receive W.
The Queen and Princesses are away, so I have nothing
to do. The Royal Palace is opposite&mdash;a big square
building.</p>

<p class="author">7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Paten&ocirc;tre and all his Legation appeared. They
brought us some picture papers with the Coronation,
proclamation (the Heralds dressed in cloth of gold, and
preceded by trumpeters) and ball. They say the
Graphic is the best, but they hadn't it, you might perhaps,
June 10th. We went for a drive with M. Mathias,
who will be our cicerone here, as he knows Stockholm
well. We went to the Royal Park, which is handsome&mdash;fine
old trees and all&eacute;es, and to the Observatory, from
which generally there is a beautiful view of Stockholm
and its surroundings&mdash;but it was grey and misty, raining
even a little, so we didn't see much.</p>

<p>We are to dine quietly here and go after dinner to a
camp where soldiers and peasants play games and dance
and sing, in honour of St. Jean.</p>

<p>The river is still covered with little green boats darting
about in every direction.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">H&ocirc;tel D'europe, Stockholm,</span><br >
Monday, June 25th, 1883.</p>


<p>My Dear, this is the most enchanting place. The sun
is out this morning, and the river and green hills too
lovely. The river is most animated, quantities of sail
boats and ordinary little rowing boats flying about in all
directions, and plenty of life on the quais. Our expedition
last night was not very successful. M. Mathias
came to dinner early, at 7 (almost everyone dines at 6),
and we went off to the camp. It was a pretty drive all
along the river, and would have been nice if it had been
clear, but it was a cold, grey evening, and began to rain
a little before we got home. We found plenty of people
looking on&mdash;various carriages drawn up, and it is evidently
a thing to do&mdash;on a fine night people get out
and walk about in the crowd, but as it was misting a
little and decidedly muddy, we merely looked on from
the carriage. One of the military bands played very well,
a sort of quickstep, and the people danced with a certain
entrain, but there were no particular steps, nor
national dances, nothing very different from what one
would see in a French assembl&eacute;e when the people dance
on the pelouse before the Mairie. When they were all
dancing round a may-pole dressed with greens, it was
pretty, with soldiers and the Dalecarlian women&mdash;there
were policemen, but not many, and the people looked
quite peaceable and happy, evidently enjoying themselves
immensely. There were quite a number of children&mdash;little
tots that looked as if they could just walk,
joining in the ring. Some of the costumes were pretty.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_137" title="pg 137"> </a>
The Dalecarlian women looked well&mdash;they wear a high
black cap which is very effective on their fair hair, which
is plaited in heavy braids, and goes around the head
like a turban; a white bodice, bright coloured apron, and
gold or silver charms and hair-pins. The language
sounded hard&mdash;no more the soft Russian tongue&mdash;and,
alas! I am afraid no more the long, beautiful Russian
twilight. The sky is grey and the clouds low. They
say we are going to have a spell of rain.</p>

<p>Mathias says the language is not at all difficult to
learn, and it is absolutely necessary to know it, particularly
for anyone who is here in any sort of business
capacity.</p>

<p>We got home about 10 and went in to pay a visit to
the Baldwins, who have the rooms next to us. They
had intended going too to the camp, but the rain
frightened them off. We told them they hadn't missed
much. The Admiral is charming&mdash;has been everywhere,
seen everything, and takes such a practical American view
of everything. He was not at all impressed with all the
magnificence of Moscow&mdash;"All show (not much of a
one) and hollow. What is there underneath?" However,
I said I thought the show was pretty good as far
as it went, and certainly no other country in the world
could offer such a sight; to which he replied, smilingly,
that I had been so long away from America that I had
forgotten what it was like. I stuck to my guns, and said
that certainly not all the intelligence, energy, education,
and money of America could produce such a pageant.
What was so wonderful was the contrast. All the modern
life and luxury grafted upon that old half-Eastern,
half-barbaric world. I think I shall never again see
anything like the dinner of the Emperor and Empress
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_138" title="pg 138"> </a>
the day of the Coronation. It looked exactly like some
old medi&aelig;val picture as they sat there in their robes and
crowns in that old dark-vaulted room of the old palace.
We had quite an animated discussion. I fancy he always
takes the opposite side on principle.</p>

<p>This morning we have been very energetic. Mathias
came at 10 o'clock, and we started off sight-seeing. We
walked across to the Palace, which is directly opposite,
and were there about an hour. There is not much to
see, the rooms are large and high, all very simply furnished.
Those that give on the river are very gay with
all the water life of the city passing under the windows.
There is one large gallery "des glaces" rather like the
famous one at Versailles, which they told us was beautiful
when it was lighted. There are quantities of portraits
everywhere, and these, of course, are interesting;
also some fine china, large vases. We saw, of course,
Bernadotte's room, left exactly as it was when he died
there. It was a curious mixture of French and Swedish,
several French papers and brochures lying about on the
tables just as he had left them, quite yellow with age and
the print fading, also note-books and "projets de loi" annot&eacute;s
in his handwriting. They say he never knew a
word of Swedish and yet was so popular. There was a
fine portrait of him over the fireplace, a handsome man,
with fine soldierly bearing.</p>

<p>We found a nice open carriage waiting for us at the
door of the Palace and drove off to Drottningholm, one
of the Royal residences on Lake Malar. The drive was
charming, through pretty green country, and as soon
as we came near the Lake, villas (generally white) in
every direction. We crossed various little arms of the
lake before we arrived at the Ch&acirc;teau. It is an enormous
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_139" title="pg 139"> </a>
pile, and stands very well in a large park. The
Governor, a fine old soldier (who rather reminded me of
Marshal MacMahon), was waiting for us with his son,
and showed us everything. The rooms are large and
bright and exceedingly simple. It seems the Royal
Family are very fond of the place. There is so much
room that they can have as many people staying as they
like, and they all live on the water. We drove through
the park, and saw the Governor's villa, not far from the
Palace. As we had been going since 10 o'clock the idea
of tea was not disagreeable, so we consulted our coachman
(at least Mathias did, as we couldn't talk), and he
told us there was a good little caf&eacute; in the park, at one
end, far from the Ch&acirc;teau, where the public were allowed,
so we stopped there and had a very good cup of
tea. It was cool and green, and we rather liked sitting
there with the lake before us in the drowsy quiet of a
summer afternoon. However we had to get back to
Stockholm, as W. had to make a visit to the Ministre
des Affaires &Eacute;trang&egrave;res. He sent him word just as we
were starting that the King would receive him to-morrow
at one o'clock. He must also see if he can borrow
anywhere a Swedish grand cordon. He sent all his decorations
back to Paris with his uniform, quite forgetting
that he might want some on his way home, and they tell
him he must have his, that the King is very particular
about such matters, and wouldn't be at all pleased if he
presented himself without his order. Paten&ocirc;tre's is no
good, as it isn't the same order.</p>

<p>We left W. the carriage and walked home, stopping
and looking at all the shop windows. I don't know that
there is much to buy, but we are going on a real shopping
expedition to-morrow morning. Mathias showed
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_140" title="pg 140"> </a>
us some queer old streets and houses and a famous shop
where there were all sorts of fishing outfits. He is very
anxious that we should go on to Norway, see Christiania
and some of the famous fiords. He says the country is
much finer than any part of Sweden, and there is much
more "couleur locale." It is just the season for it. I
should like it extremely, but I am afraid W. won't. He
wants to get home, and must stay three or four days at
Copenhagen, where there is a fine collection of medals.</p>

<p>Now I am sitting writing at the window, waiting until
it is time to dress for dinner at the Legation. The river
is a perpetual enjoyment, always something going on.
A big boat has just put off from the American man-of-war.
The men look a fine sturdy lot, and come up in
great style with a good, long stroke. They attract much
attention, for as soon as the boat left the ship a little
crowd gathered and watched their progress.</p>

<p>Here is W., who enjoyed his visit to the minister very
much&mdash;found him easy and intelligent, and much interested
in the Coronation. They will send him a plaque
and a ribbon from the jewellers, so he will be quite correct
to-morrow. Adela&iuml;de is much disturbed because I
have neither fine dress nor jewels for the dinner to-night.
It really is not of the slightest consequence, as
I am the only lady (Paten&ocirc;tre is a bachelor), and we are
going to the gardens afterwards. I shall wear Delannoy's
blue and white striped silk, half long, and take my
hat in my hand, as it must go on for our outing.</p>

<p class="author">12 o'clock.</p>

<p>We have just come in from our dinner, which was
pleasant and very good, merely the three, Mathias,
Paten&ocirc;tre, and one of his secretaries, M. de Bondy. The
house is large, nice, and looks very pretty, as the Minister
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_141" title="pg 141"> </a>
has been both in China and Persia and has brought back
some beautiful things, carpets, tentures, and curios of all
kinds. He evidently didn't find Pekin a very pleasant
or healthy residence, says the cold is something awful.
He likes Stockholm, says the Swedes are pleasant, kindly
people, lead simple lives, and do all they can to make it
pleasant for the Corps Diplomatique. There are few
large fortunes&mdash;very little life, and little private entertaining.
The Court gives several balls and dinners every
year.</p>

<p>About 8.30 we went off to the gardens and restaurant
Haselbach, where all the beau monde of Stockholm assembles
in summer, but the season is over and there
were not many people there&mdash;of <em>Society</em>; <em>people</em> there
were, plenty. The gardens are large, well lighted, a very
good band was playing, and everyone walking up and
down the broad all&eacute;es, or seated at little tables with tea
and punch. We sat there about an hour. Paten&ocirc;tre
pointed out various notabilities to us, but said he didn't
know many people.</p>

<p>Now we are discussing routes with maps and books.
We shall start for Copenhagen to-morrow night vi&acirc;
Malmo, and must send in the morning to engage our
sleepings. It is a long journey. We leave here at 8.30,
and don't get to Copenhagen until 4.30 the next day.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, June 26th.</p>

<p>It is lovely again this morning. Richard and I and
Mathias have been wandering about the streets shopping.
There isn't much to buy&mdash;Norwegian knives with
carved wooden handles in a leather case, Scandinavian
charms, buckles, and brooches roughly worked, but
rather pretty and curious shapes&mdash;furs, too, of course, but
we didn't want any more. I was rather tempted by a
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_142" title="pg 142"> </a>
large white stuffed bear. I thought it would look so well
in the hall in the country; but of course the only reason to
have a bear in the house is when you shot it yourself, and
that was not possible in the streets of Stockholm in the
month of June. The day is divine&mdash;sky blue and water
dancing. The whole aspect of the place is much gayer
than anything we saw in Russia. People don't look sad
or preoccupied; there are always
<ins title="Transcriber's note: original text read 'babauds'">badauds</ins> hanging over
the bridges and exchanging jokes or remarks with the
watermen.</p>

<p>Richard and I breakfasted t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te, as W. had gone
off for his Royal audience. His plaque and grand cordon
came in time from the jeweller, so he was quite
proper. I shall go and see about the trunks, and as soon
as W. comes back we shall start again for some last sightseeing,
the Museum, churches, etc. We dine at 6 and
start at 8 from the hotel. Richard has decided to wait
a day longer and go and see the Falls of Upsala, which
are quite worth seeing. Mathias will go with him, and
he will join us at Copenhagen Thursday. The Baldwins
have just come in to say good-bye. They, too, are leaving
to-morrow.</p>

<p>I will finish, as I have a quiet hour before dinner. I
left the gentlemen at the Museum, as I was not very well,
and thought better to rest a little before starting this
evening. W. came in a little after two, having enjoyed
the hour with the King very much. He says he is a
tall, handsome man, very intelligent, and well up in
everything. He received him quite informally in his
cabinet de travail, which he said had also been Bernadotte's.
There was a good picture of him on the walls.
He was much interested in the Coronation, though he
had heard all about it already from his son, but he was
anxious to have W.'s impressions. He said <em>he</em> personally
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_143" title="pg 143"> </a>
had never been very anxious about a Nihilist plot at that
time. He didn't think they would choose that opportunity.
He was much interested in everything French,
literature, politics, theatres, and asked W. if he was
going back to Petersburg as Ambassador. He also
asked him if he had ever been in America, as he believed
he had married an American, and was much surprised to
hear he had never crossed the big pond. He told him
too just what some of the Swedish diplomats told me,
that all his best young men went to America. They got
such high wages, and got on so well, that they were all
leaving Sweden. I remember Sandford telling us years
ago in Paris, that all the workmen on his orange plantations
in Florida were Swedes.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%"><a href="#illustrations"><img src="images/illus160.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="M. William Waddington" id="illus160" title="M. William Waddington"> </a>

<p class="center small">M. William Waddington<br >
From a copyright photograph by Russell &amp; Son</p></div>

<p>W. had just time to get out of his dress clothes, and
send back his order when Mathias appeared, and we went
for a last tourn&eacute;e. First to the Church des Chevaliers,
where all the Swedish Kings are buried, up and down
some old streets where there are curious old houses, and
wound up at the Museum. I only stayed there half an
hour, saw some of the pictures and souvenirs of Charles
IX, and then came home, leaving the others.</p>

<p>Now we have finished packing, I have on my travelling
dress, and am seated quietly at the window with
my book, Tolstoy's "La Guerre et la Paix," but I don't
make much progress&mdash;I am always looking out. A
big steam yacht has just come in&mdash;ran straight up the
river alongside of the "Lancaster." About twenty little
boats have immediately started out, going close up to the
yacht, and they have sent off a steam launch, which has
come up to the wharf in about five minutes.</p>

<p>Paten&ocirc;tre and his secretary have come to say good-bye,
and to say that all the orders are given for this
evening, and we shall have our sleepings. I wonder
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_144" title="pg 144"> </a>

if you have seen Pont&eacute;coulant. He said he would go
at once to find you. He has been saving up all he heard
about the Americans and their frock coats and grey
trousers (when everyone else was covered with gold embroidery
and orders) for you, and hopes to get a good rise
out of you.</p>

<p>My next letter will be from Copenhagen&mdash;then Hamburg
and home. The gentlemen have come in&mdash;found
the Museum very interesting, and we shall dine in a few
minutes, so this must stop and will go off from here by
the evening courier.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Copenhagen</span>,<br >
Wednesday, June 27th, 1883.</p>

<p>We arrived at one o'clock to-day, Dear, not tired at
all, as our journey was easy. We had a capital waggon,
a large sleeping carriage, a bed on each side, and a good
toilette. We started punctually at 8.30, through fairly
pretty country, nothing very picturesque, but a general
impression of verdure. At 10.30 we stopped somewhere,
had tea, and the man came and made the beds. I
slept quite well. We took the steamer at Malmo, breakfasted
on board, and enjoyed the crossing. The sea was
beautiful and there were quantities of boats of all kinds.
There was a thick fog for about half an hour, which was
very uncomfortable, for we knew how many boats there
were all around us, and as soon as our own whistle
stopped, we heard many others unpleasantly near. However
it lifted as we neared Copenhagen.</p>

<p>The approach is good, but not nearly so fine as Stockholm.
There are no islands and the country all about is
very flat. The quantity of boats of all kinds made it a
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_145" title="pg 145"> </a>
very pretty sight. We found M. de Kergorlay, Charg&eacute;
d'Affaires, waiting for us on the quai with a carriage, and
drove at once to the hotel. We wanted a little time to
change, read our letters (we found a quantity, two from
you), which you may imagine I was glad to have. I
am so glad the boy has kept well&mdash;I am getting very
homesick for him now that our faces are turned homewards.
M. de Kergorlay said he would come back at
4 and take us a drive. W. too found various letters and
papers. We started again at 4 and had a beautiful drive
to the "Deer Park" for some distance along the sea, with
quantities of villas, casinos, caf&eacute;s with music all the way.
There were some very pretty carriages, officers riding,
and every description of pleasure boat, big and small, on
the sea. Just as we were leaving the sea and turning
into the forest we met a big break, with the Prince Royal
driving himself and his family. The carriage was full of
children. He recognized of course Kergorlay, then W.&mdash;however
they are all in the country. We shall have
no visits nor audiences of any kind. I am rather sorry
not to see the Prince. He was in Paris and dined with
us the Exhibition year, when W. was at the Quai d'Orsay,
and I found him most sympathetic, and very good-looking.</p>

<p>It was so pretty driving through the deer park. We
had tea in one of the casinos, standing high over the sea,
with a splendid view. We dined quietly at the hotel at
a small table in the dining-room. We saw there General
Appert and his family dining. They had come to Copenhagen
to see their son, who is military attach&eacute; here
(Madame Appert is a Dane), also Harry Whitehouse,
who said they were in the country, but not far, and would
certainly come in and see us. I have written a few notes
since dinner, and W. has also sent one to be given early
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_146" title="pg 146"> </a>
to-morrow morning to the Conservateur des M&eacute;dailles
at the Museum. The hotel is very comfortable, we have
an enormous salon on the front, and good bedrooms.
Adela&iuml;de has fraternised with the Apperts' maid, and is
delighted to have a compatriote to go about with. I
was interrupted, as W. suggested we should go out and
make a little turn in the streets while he smoked a cigar.
The town is much less gay than Stockholm. All the
houses are built of grey stone, and are high and narrow,
rather like New York. There are a good many people
in the streets and in the trams, of which there seem
plenty.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, June 28th.</p>

<p>It is again a beautiful day, and at 10 o'clock W. and
I started. I took Adela&iuml;de, for I knew W. would be
absorbed at once by the medals, and I didn't care to
come home alone. We were received with much empressement
by the Director. As I supposed, the Conservateur
des M&eacute;dailles carried off W. at once, and a
sub. of some kind was deputed to show me the Historical
Museum, which really is very interesting, costumes
and interior groups of figures of the whole world. They
say it is very exact, but what a work it must have been.
We saw it very well and fairly quickly, as it wasn't a
public day, and the young man only showed us what
was worth seeing. We walked home. It wasn't far,
and he explained the route to us. I really needed the
exercise. The town is decidedly gloomy, even in the
bright sunlight, and might be any Northern town anywhere.</p>

<p>I breakfasted alone at a small table in the dining-room,
and had the big room almost to myself&mdash;two gentlemen
were breakfasting at one end. Almost as soon as I got
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_147" title="pg 147"> </a>
upstairs I had some visits. First Richard appeared, very
pleased with his excursion, said it would have been a
pity not to see the Falls, being so near; then came Col.
Wyckham Hoffman and Whitehouse. Hoffman was
much interested in hearing about the Coronation, as he
was five years secretary in Russia and knew all the
people. He and Mrs. Hoffman are at Elsinore for the
summer and want us very much to come down and dine
and stay over night, but I am afraid we can't. W. wants
all his time here for the coins, and it would take quite a
day to really see the place. Kergorlay came with a carriage
at three, and he and I and Richard started again for
the same drive. It seems all Copenhagen does it every
afternoon. The sea looked enchanting, and I think
there were more boats than yesterday&mdash;several big
steamers, English bound they tell us&mdash;and such quantities
of pleasure boats. We drove rather further into
the forest, as we had more time. It is really very lovely&mdash;had
tea in another casino with the same view of
the sea. We met various private carriages with good
horses, a certain number were breaks full of nurses and
children; and some rather smart-looking officers well
mounted. We didn't meet the Royal break again. It
seems they are all (a big family party) at one of their
ch&acirc;teaux near Copenhagen, and come into town very
often. Kergorlay seems to like Copenhagen&mdash;not the
climate, he says it is cold and foggy, there are days when
one never sees the sun. It makes rather a gloomy impression
on me. If I lived here I too would want to
come every day to the Deer Park, which wouldn't be
convenient perhaps for domestic arrangements.</p>

<p>The streets are curiously banal&mdash;I wonder why? Of
course one didn't expect to find the colour and half-Eastern
look of Moscow, nor the gay half "bains-de mer"
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_148" title="pg 148"> </a>
impression of Stockholm, but I am disappointed.
One thinks of Danes as descendants of the Vikings,
heroes, enormous men with long limbs and yellow hair.
Do you remember the poem we were so mad about in
the days of our youth, "Word was brought to the Danish
King that the love of his heart lay dying"? I can see
Mrs. Lawrence sitting at the table, and reading it in her
full rich voice. I don't remember now who wrote it,
but I am sure you will&mdash;and Copenhagen looks singularly
unpoetical and modern. We found W. on the balcony
when we got back, with his papers and his cigar, just
tired enough after a long day's work in the Museum to
appreciate a quiet hour. It has been warm all day, and is
still. We felt the difference as soon as we turned into
the streets, and we haven't the river under our windows
as we had at Stockholm, and always a breeze.</p>

<p class="author">4 o'clock.</p>

<p>Richard and I are just back from an expedition to
Tivoli&mdash;the great garden here. We dined quietly at
home, and I tried to persuade W. to come with us to the
garden, but he declined absolutely, so we left him talking
and smoking with General Appert, and we two started
off in a fiacre. We were rather pleased with ourselves
and the way we got along in a strange place and a strange
tongue. We even made out strawberries and cream&mdash;"med"
and something else I forget now. I don't know
which was strawberries and which was cream, but we got
them, and <em>med</em> was evidently one or the other. The
garden is very pretty, very well arranged, with every
variety of entertainment. We sat and listened to the
band (a very good one, military) while we had <em>med</em> and
&mdash;&mdash;, and then went into one or two of the small
theatres and concert halls. All this too was modern,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_149" title="pg 149"> </a>
might have been Paris or London. We saw one or two
of our diplomatic friends disporting themselves at one
of the theatres where there were "poses plastiques" very
well done. I think they were "en gar&ccedil;on"&mdash;the pink
flower hats they were alongside of didn't give me a
family impression.</p>

<p>We rather enjoyed our evening lounging about. A
fortune teller, a rather pretty girl, evidently wished to
tell our fortunes, <em>that</em> we made out by signs and the cards
she had spread out before her, but we didn't think our
knowledge of the Danish tongue was sufficient to understand
all she would tell us of a brilliant future. Richard
is delightful to go about with. He likes to see everything
and know about everything, and certainly succeeds
in some curious way getting all the information he wants.
W. was poring over his notes when we got back. We
told him all our experiences, and then talked a little
about our day to-morrow.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, June 29th.</p>

<p>It has been frightfully hot all day. I stayed at home
all the morning. W. and Richard went off early to the
Museum. I had a visit from Kergorlay. He has an interesting
face, is a widower, poor fellow, with four children,
one boy of two and a half. They say he is so
devoted to the children. I told him I should like to see
them, and he will send them&mdash;at any rate we shall see
them to-morrow night, as we dine at the Legation. Richard
came back to breakfast. He said it was cool enough
in the Museum, and we started off for the Thorwaldsen
Gallery. Of course some of the statues and has reliefs are
very fine, but they are enormous, almost more than life
size. We went on to the Frauen Kirche to see his statues
of the 12 Apostles which are there. They were strangely
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_150" title="pg 150"> </a>
familiar. We must have seen them reproduced in plaster
at home. Both St. Peter and St. John I knew quite well,
and didn't like them much. While we were loitering
about the church the suisse told us a wedding was just
going to take place, it might perhaps amuse us to see it,
so we stepped into one of the side aisles and saw the
cort&eacute;ge. The bride was the regulation white-veiled figure,
I think she had a <em>green</em> wreath (it may have been
myrtle like the German brides), the man was in uniform.
What was really interesting was the dress of the two
pastors. They wore black coats with white ruffles, just
as they did in Luther's time. That reconciled me a little
to this very uninteresting town.</p>

<p>It was still very warm, but we did a little shopping,
photographs and one or two trifles. Richard leaves to-night
at 7.30, and we shall dine early with him. He
is to stop a day or two with Mary at Meiningen, pick
up his mother who is there, and bring her back to
France. Mary wanted us to come, and I wish we could
have managed it. It would have been nice to have been
there all together, and they would have enjoyed hearing
all our impressions while they were so absolutely
fresh, particularly Charles, who leads a very quiet life now
ever since his accident at the Quai d'Orsay. It is extraordinary
how the last thing seen remains in one's memory.
Already Moscow and that splendid pageant is fading
a little, and I see Stockholm, and the green islands,
and the dancing river.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, June 30th.</p>

<p>It is still frightfully hot&mdash;not a breath of air. I have
made as much of a draught as I can by opening the door
into the passage. It isn't very convenient, as we are just
at the head of the big staircase, but I have put a high-backed
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_151" title="pg 151"> </a>
arm-chair between me and the passers by. It was
really very warm until 11 o'clock last night. We dined
downstairs with Richard, and were very sorry to see
him go. Then we went to Mrs. Baldwin (the Admiral
had gone off for two days) to ask her if she would drive
with us. We made the usual turn, the only variety being
our tea place&mdash;we take a new one every time. The
g&eacute;rant of the hotel explains to the coachman where to
go, and he chooses very well. It was lovely driving, and
so cool on the top of the cliff that we walked about a
little after tea. There is always a long, clear evening,
not like Russia, but still very pleasant and pretty, such a
soft light over everything. The moment we turned away
from the sea back into the town we felt the difference,
but the long drive had cooled us. I have asked for my
breakfast upstairs in the salon. I really can't dress and
sit in that hot room in this weather. W. is at the
Museum, but comes back at 4 with the Director, who
is to show us some of the treasures of the town. I
am getting on very well here with "La Guerre et la
Paix," as I am not distracted all the time as I was at
Stockholm. I think you would like it, the <em>Russian</em> side
of Napoleon's great campaign is so interesting, also the
pictures of the society of Moscow at that time, which
they say is extremely well done.</p>

<p>W. came in about 4, not very warm, as he says the
rooms of the Museum are cool, with such thick walls, and
while we were waiting for Monsieur Warsoe, the Directeur,
Mr. Vivian, English Minister, paid us a visit. He
is very anxious we should come and see them at Elsinore,
says it is most interesting (all memories of Hamlet). I
should like it extremely, but W. thinks we must get
home. I liked Vivian very much. He talked very easily
about everything&mdash;he is going to dine with us at Kergorlay's,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_152" title="pg 152"> </a>
says all the colleagues are most anxious to hear
about the Coronation. M. Warsoe appeared about 4.30
and we drove at once to Rosenburg, an old ch&acirc;teau
where there is a fine collection of all sorts of things.
Some of the Danish porcelain was lovely, also some fine
tapestries. They showed us with much pride their
tr&eacute;sor, jewels, and gold and silver services, but really
after Moscow and the quantities of gold, silver, enamel,
crowns, and jewels of all sorts that one had seen the
others made no effect, though of course there were some
handsome stones, rubies. What I did like was the 4 lions
(couchant) of massive silver, which are always put at each
side of the throne whenever there is a great ceremony
at Court. They must look splendid.</p>

<p>We went again to the Frauen Kirche, as W. had not
seen it, and the second time I liked the Apostles better,
a little better. I think it was too hot, and I was too
tired when I was there before. We drove out to an old
bridge, which was curious, and in some old street where
I had never penetrated. The trams worry me, they are
so frightfully civilized and up-to-date, however they were
crowded, so evidently the Danes are not of my way of
thinking.</p>

<p>Our dinner at Kergorlay's was very pleasant and
handsome. Adela&iuml;de was again frightfully put out at my
garment, and she is right, it is really a street dress, and
this time there are several women. I don't know why
I didn't keep out <em>one</em> evening dress. It was rather
stupid to send everything back. However, I made my
excuses to the ladies, and said I was "en touriste." They
were all very &eacute;l&eacute;gantes, though they were all already
settled in the country, and went off about 10 o'clock by
the last train. Kergorlay's children came in before dinner.
The eldest girl is 10, and the baby two and a half.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_153" title="pg 153"> </a>
It was so pathetic to see them in their white dresses and
black sashes and to think whom the mourning was for.
The dinner was very gay. We had Count and Countess
Toll (he is Russian Minister here, and a brother of Countess
Pahlen), Marochetti (Italian Minister) and his wife (a
Frenchwoman, n&eacute;e Grandval), Vivian (she didn't come,
was in the country and rather exhausted with the great
heat), General and Madame Appert, and two secretaries.
Count Toll was very keen to hear all about Moscow, and
what we thought of the great show (he speaks English
quite well). I told him we were enchanted, and that one
of the great features was Comte Pahlen with his velvet
coat and white staff of office with a big sapphire at the
top. He certainly took no end of trouble, and looked
his part very well. They all seem to like Copenhagen
pretty well, except for the climate, which seems most trying.
Countess Toll was in white with handsome pearls.
I felt rather like a pensionnaire in my simple little dress&mdash;foolish,
too; I ought to have known better.</p>

<p>We got home quite early, so I can still have a little
Tolstoy before I go to bed. Adela&iuml;de instantly inquired
what the other ladies had on and was much put out.
"C'&eacute;tait Madame l'Ambassadrice qui &eacute;tait le plus mal"&mdash;"oh!
cela oui, et de beaucoup." I suppose it reflects
upon the femme de chambre when the mistress is not up
to the mark.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, July 1st.</p>

<p>It is still frightfully hot. I did not go out all morning,
though they sent a notice of services at the English
Church. We shall leave to-morrow night for Hamburg.
W. says two days more of medals will give him
all he wants. After breakfast I went to see Mrs. Baldwin,
whom I found gasping, sitting with open doors and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_154" title="pg 154"> </a>
windows; also Madame Appert, who looked quite cool
and comfortable, as did her two daughters, pretty girls;
however, they said they didn't feel cool. When I got
back to our rooms I found several cards, and then Mrs.
Hoffman appeared. She was very nice and friendly, sent
all sorts of messages to you and Anne, and wished Anne
would come and stay with her at Elsinore. She likes
Copenhagen very much, says the people are friendly and
hospitable and invite the diplomats; also that some of
the country places are very fine, quite in the English
style. She made a great appeal to me to come to Elsinore
with her this afternoon, I could come back to-morrow
in plenty of time for the night train, but I
couldn't manage. W. was still at the Museum, and
would have been in a great state of mind if he had come
home and found not me but a note saying I had departed
for Elsinore. While she was still here, young Moltke
appeared, our compagnon de voyage from Helsingfors
to Stockholm. He hopes to be sent to Paris or London.
I told him if it was Paris he must look us up. He is a
very nice young fellow, very good-looking, tall, and fair.</p>

<p>We have had our usual drive. We dined at 5 and
started out rather earlier. If possible there were more
people than we had ever seen before, as it was Sunday and
f&ecirc;te. All Copenhagen, high and low, were on their way
to the Deer Park. A stream of conveyances of all descriptions,
some peasants' carts with straw at the bottom
filled with women and children, everybody in a good
humour. There were fewer officers riding, and fewer big
boats on the sea, but endless little pleasure yachts. As
we came back it was really a pretty sight, all the caf&eacute;s,
casinos, etc., brilliantly lighted, all the villas, too, and
people sitting on the verandas, some playing cards,
some at tea tables, some walking about in the gardens,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_155" title="pg 155"> </a>
we could see the light dresses fluttering about in the
shrubberies; animation, laughter, voices, music everywhere.
We stopped as usual for tea at one of the high
casinos&mdash;the sea blue and calm at our feet some distance
down, and the whole summer out-door life of Copenhagen
behind in the woods and hills. It was delicious
driving back, and even the streets were pretty to-night,
so many people, and the cool air such a relief after the
terrible heat of the day. We have decided to start at
8.30 to-morrow evening.</p>

<p>I tried to glean some information from a Danish paper
this afternoon. Col. Hoffman told me that if one knew
English or German one could read Danish quite well, giving
oneself a little trouble, but I can't say that was my
experience. It might have been Hebrew for all I made
out. I suppose I didn't keep at it long enough. It
doesn't sound easy when one hears the language spoken
all about one, rather harsh. I mastered a little Swedish
(to understand it) much more easily.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Copenhagen</span>,<br >
Monday, July 2d, 1883.</p>

<p>The heat is something awful to-day,&mdash;I think the
worst day we have had. I was up early, as the salon is
cooler than the bedroom, more doors and windows. W.
is off to his medals until 5, and we leave to-night for
Hamburg. The trunks are made (almost for the last
time), as we shall stay only one night in Hamburg, and
arrive in Paris Thursday morning. I had a nice visit
from Kergorlay. He can't come to the station to see
us off, as he dines with the King in the country, but
will send his chancelier to see about places, luggage, etc.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_156" title="pg 156"> </a>
We talked a great deal about his children. He feels such
a responsibility, and it is hard for a man to have such a
young family to look after. He said their mother was
so devoted to them&mdash;it seems hard she couldn't have
been left to them a little longer.</p>

<p>I breakfasted downstairs, had a little talk with the
Apperts, and then went to the reading-room for a little
while to see if there was any news. The Comte de
Chambord is very ill, dying they say. I wonder if his
death will make any difference now&mdash;I suppose not. He
has been only a memory practically all these years, as he
never came to France, and only a few, a very few fid&egrave;les
clung to him in his exile. I must say I rather admired
him always. According to his lights (limited I grant),
he was absolutely consistent.</p>

<p>I had another visit from Col. Hoffman, who came to
see if we were really going to-night. We have a despatch
from Richard saying that we will have much difficulty
in getting into any hotel in Hamburg&mdash;the town
is very full. There are races going on, also a scientific
congress of some kind&mdash;however, the proprietor of this
hotel says it is all right, they will keep us rooms. W.
came in at 5, having been working steadily since 9.30 this
morning. He took a cordial leave of the various Conservateurs
and Directors, but thinks they were not sorry
to see him go, and take up their quiet life, two or three
hours a day in the cabinet instead of 6 or 7.</p>

<p>My next letter will be from Hamburg&mdash;and after that
I will <em>tell</em> all I have seen and done, which will be much
easier than writing.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Railway Station, Kiel, 7 <small>A.M.</small>,</span><br >
Tuesday, July 3d.</p>

<p>We have two hours to wait here, so I will scribble a
line to you, which will help to pass the time. We got
off very early last night. Some of the young men from
the Legation were waiting at the station with a servant
to help us with our baggage. It really was not necessary,
as we have only two trunks, and the porter of the
hotel is most helpful and energetic. It was very warm
even at that hour, and the compartment was stuffy, a
good many passengers. We got to Korsoe about 11.
The boat was directly opposite the station, and we went
on board at once. There was some delay getting the
baggage on board, so we sat quietly on deck and had our
tea, and cooled off. The cabin felt so hot when I went
down to leave my things that I couldn't make up my
mind to install myself, particularly as the crossing (the
Belt) was short, about 5 hours. The Captain said we
should arrive between 4 and 5 at Kiel. We stayed on
deck till nearly one o'clock. It was a lovely night, the
sea quite calm, but a good breeze once outside, which
freshened considerably as we drew away from the land.</p>

<p>I went down about one, but didn't get much sleep,
and was quite ready to go up on deck when they called
me at 4.30, and said we were approaching Kiel. Almost
all the passengers were on deck. The approach is not
particularly interesting. I heard two gentlemen discussing
us in English. They had seen our trunks all labelled
<em>Waddington, Couronnement</em>, had taken renseignements
from the Captain, who assured them W. was the
French Ambassador. They thought he must be mistaken.
"That man is an Englishman&mdash;he is speaking English
now to the lady&mdash;I have heard them talking always in
English. They certainly are not French." They hovered
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_158" title="pg 158"> </a>
about us, and then looked rather bewildered, for Adela&iuml;de
came up to ask me something, and then W. and I
finished our talk in French. We speak sometimes
French, sometimes English, it depends upon our milieu.</p>

<p>The harbour is fine as one gets up to it. How hard for
the Danes to give it up, and how they must hate the
Germans. We got off about 5.30. The city was still
wrapped in sleep. We walked about a little, and it was a
curious sensation to walk about in apparently a dead
town. We had some breakfast at the station, and have
been out again. Then (7 o'clock) the town was quite
lively, workmen moving about. We shall start in about a
quarter of an hour, and have about two hours and a half
to Hamburg. The long wait here has been tiresome,
nearly three hours. The movement on the water and
the quais was amusing, but really until after 7 not a
soul was stirring, at least not in this quarter, and no trains
coming or going.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Hamburg</span>,<br >
Tuesday, July 3d, 1883.</p>

<p>No words can tell, Dear, how uncomfortable we are,
hot and cross. We arrived at 11, after a very hot, dusty
journey. The town is crammed, even at this hotel where
they had kept rooms for us (and such nasty little rooms,
a small salon, giving on the street it is true, so that we
can see all that goes on, and two minute bedrooms on one
side) we can't get our trunks, nor apparently our breakfast.
The hotel people are quite affol&eacute;s. There are
races (with a German Prince of some kind either presiding
or running horses, I can't make out which), "a horticultural
show, a cattle fair, (and an anniversary of something)."</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_159" title="pg 159"> </a></p>

<p>We said we would take a carriage this afternoon and
drive about the city, and we might just as well have asked
for a balloon&mdash;nothing to be had before 7 o'clock. I
should think every carriage in Hamburg was out&mdash;quantities
of all kinds and large omnibuses are passing under
the windows, filled with women in light dresses, and
a generally festive appearance. They hope to give us
one then.</p>

<p>We have had breakfast&mdash;the dining-room large, fairly
cool, and empty (as it was late everyone had breakfasted
and flown). They brought us the Figaro. The Comte de
Chambord is dead, and the Comte de Paris starting for
the funeral. Just as we had got upstairs again the man
of the hotel came and asked if Madame l'Ambassadrice
de France would receive Madame l'Ambassadrice de
France. We were rather puzzled, but said of course we
would receive anyone who came, and in walked M. et
Mdme. de Courcel, and M. de Pina, our Consul here, M.
de Sancy, the military attach&eacute; at Berlin. We were delighted
to see them. The Courcels had been paying a
visit to the Duke of Sagan in his splendid place, and,
being not far from Hamburg, had come on to see the
town. They were going to the races with M. de Pina,
and wanted us to come, but we didn't care to (and indeed
I don't know how we should have gone, as they
had a small carriage which just held them, and we had
none). M. de Pina asked us to dine with the Courcels
at 8.30, and that we were very glad to do, as the prospect
of a dinner in the big dining-room, with all the crowd
of hungry people back from the various festivities, was
not alluring. Pina told us as we couldn't get a carriage
we had better take one of the small steamers that ply
about in the inner harbour, and have an hour's sail. He
was sure we would find it pretty and interesting. It
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_160" title="pg 160"> </a>
would certainly be cooler than sitting in that stuffy little
salon.</p>

<p>There is nothing to see now in the streets, as the whole
population is out of town, and the rumbling of carriages
has ceased for the moment. W. is lying back in an arm-chair,
with a cigar, in his shirt sleeves, groaning with the
heat; and very hot it must be to reduce him to that state.
I have a theory that no Waddington knows what heat
means. No words can describe what I feel. Certainly
fine feathers make fine birds, and I think no one would
recognize the gold embroidered, bejewelled couple that
went in the coup&eacute; d'Orsay to the gala dinner at the
Palace.</p>

<p class="author">11 o'clock.</p>

<p>We are just in from the Consul's dinner, and as it
is cooler in the salon with the windows open than in my
room, I will finish my letter to-night. We start to-morrow
morning at 9 o'clock for Cologne and Paris. Now
that we are getting so near I am very homesick for the
boy, and for my own house. The constant moving
about and living in hotels for the last fortnight has been
tiring. I have got nothing left either to say to anybody&mdash;I
have described the Coronation so many times that it
is almost mechanical now&mdash;the words come by themselves&mdash;a
steady stream, like the paper that rolls off
the telegrams. I think I should never do for a <em>permanent</em>
Ambassadress if six weeks of functions have exhausted
me physically and mentally. As usual tho' last
impressions are the strongest. I have already forgotten
Moscow a little, and see the journey from Petersburg to
Stockholm more clearly than anything else. I am sorry
now that I didn't write a regular journal. Almost all the
gentlemen did, and it would have been no trouble if I had
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_161" title="pg 161"> </a>
made up my mind to it, and written regularly, but unfortunately
my writing-table at Maison Klein was on the
court, and as soon as I established myself all sorts of
interesting things immediately began to take place under
the window, and the ink was bad and thick, and I got
it all over my fingers, and even up in my hair&mdash;I hate so
to write.</p>

<p>We sat all the afternoon indoors until 6 o'clock, when
a little breeze sprang up, and we walked down a few steps
only to the wharf from which the little steamers sail.
It is about an hour, the tour round the lake, or inner
harbour&mdash;quite charming&mdash;all the shores covered with
pretty houses and villas, with lawns, and gardens full of
flowers, sloping down to the water's edge. One would
never have dreamed of finding anything so pretty and
so <em>country</em> in this very business-like place. Many of the
villas had nice little jetties and piers that ran out quite
far into the water, and pretty boats and boat-houses.
It seemed incredible to find all this so close to the
hot, crowded hotel where we had been all day. The
boat was quite full&mdash;principally business men going back
to dine and sleep at their country houses&mdash;all Germans&mdash;we
were certainly the only foreigners on the boat. It
rather reminded me of Staten Island at home&mdash;the afternoon
boat with all the business men on board, only one
didn't have the broad expanse of the beautiful New
York Bay, but a small land-locked lake.</p>

<p>The sail and breeze (such as it was) revived us, and
we had time to dress comfortably for our dinner. We
didn't see the great port&mdash;divined it only, with the forest
of masts of all sizes.</p>

<p>Our dinner was very pretty and pleasant. Our host
was some time in Holland, and has some lovely specimens
of blue Delft, and some fine carved furniture. We had
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_162" title="pg 162"> </a>
only M. and Mdme. de Courcel (who arrived very late,
having been caught in the file of carriages coming from
the races), M. de Sancy, the first magistrate of the city,
the Burgomaster, all in black, a plain tight coat, with a
white fraise, very stiff and high around his neck, and a
long gold chain. Also two of the principal merchants
of Hamburg&mdash;the Courcels were staying with one of
them, as they could get no rooms anywhere. The house
was almost shut up&mdash;all the family out of town, and a
femme de charge to look after them. They said the
rooms were very comfortable, and they took their meals
at a restaurant or with M. de Pina, who is certainly most
hospitable.</p>

<p>W. was delighted to see Courcel and tell him all about
the Coronation, and his impressions of all the people he
had seen. The Burgomaster, too, was very keen to hear
what we thought about everything. He is a clever old
man, speaking French fairly well. They all evidently
think there is much discontent in Russia, and some day
there will be a great upheaving&mdash;de Sancy told me that
Radziwill, Aide-de-Camp to the German Emperor, told
him that our equipages, horses, etc., were so good. We
thought so, but were not perhaps quite impartial. Richard
says we all used to sit up talking after every ceremony,
and say how well we did things.</p>

<p>After dinner M. de Pina showed us some of his curios,
which are interesting and very well arranged. One of
the two merchants, I quite forget the name, has a beautiful
villa on the Elbe, some little distance from Hamburg,
and wants us very much to come and make them
a visit. I was much tempted&mdash;it would be amusing to
see a bit of German business life, and I think W. would
not have minded if the invitation could be accepted at
once&mdash;but we would have to remain on here for two
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_163" title="pg 163"> </a>
days, as the gentleman is going somewhere else before
he goes home, and really two days in these horrid little
rooms would be impossible. M. de Pina told us the
villas of some of these merchant princes are beautiful,
with splendid gardens and all the luxe that money can
give. He says they spend much more for their country
houses than for their town establishments.</p>

<p>We broke up about 10, as everyone was tired. It was
a beautiful moonlight night, so we told our coachman
to take us round by the great port. It was most curious.
The water was black except just where the streak of
moonlight fell on it, and there were thousands of ships of
all kinds from all quarters of the globe&mdash;smoke coming
out of the chimneys of some of the big steamers, evidently
preparing for an early start to-morrow morning,
and <em>millions</em> of masts tapering up against the sky. Lights
in every direction, some high, some low, and even at
that hour of the night little boats flying about. One
saw a dark object start off from the wharf&mdash;suddenly
stand out well crossing the moonlight streak, and then
disappear&mdash;there was a constant sound of oars and row-locks,
and long creaking noises like pulleys, and heavy
things being hoisted on board a ship. They say the
animation, and noise, and dust, and <em>smells</em> are extraordinary
in the daytime&mdash;but at night-time all looked extremely
picturesque.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Cologne Gare</span>, 10 o'clock Mercredi soir,<br >

<p>We got off this morning at 9.30 from Hamburg, and
had a long, hot, dusty journey&mdash;nothing very pretty to
see. We arrived here about 6.30, found the Consul, Mr.
Brandt, waiting at the station with a carriage. He proposed
a drive&mdash;going first to the Cathedral, to see it by
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_164" title="pg 164"> </a>
daylight, and then to dine with him at the station, where
there is a very good restaurant, so we sent all our small
things over to the private room, and started off to the
Cathedral. I was delighted to see it again after so many
years. Do you remember it was the first European
Cathedral we saw after Notre Dame, that first year when
we came down the Rhine. How magnificent it is, outside
and inside&mdash;the long, stately vaulted aisles, so high
and so still. There was no one in the church at that
hour, and we had a delightful half hour. We walked all
around the outside, and then went back to the station
to dine&mdash;and a very good dinner it was, in the same
room where we breakfasted when we started for Russia,
now nearly two months ago, when all seemed so vague,
and rather a plunge into the unknown. We shall certainly
have souvenirs for all our lives.</p>

<p>As we were finishing dinner the Chef de Gare came to
say that a "lit-salon" was reserved for us, and he would
have all the "kleines gepack" put into the compartment,
and tell us at the last moment. The train starts at 10.30,
and we get to Paris at 10 to-morrow morning, so we
thought we would go out again and drive about a little,
as we had so long to wait. We had a nice turn in the
moonlight&mdash;the Cathedral looked beautiful, and we
crossed the Rhine and drove some little distance on the
other side of the river to have the view of the city. Now
one or two Frenchmen who are here are talking to W.
They have brought us tea, and I am scribbling this to
you.</p>

<p>It is delightful, Dear, to think that to-morrow at breakfast
I shall be telling you all this, and Baby sitting up in
his high chair, looking at me hard out of his round, blue
eyes. There is <em>one</em> good thing in getting home, I
needn't write any more letters.</p>

<p>We got back this morning at 10 o'clock. The journey
was very comfortable&mdash;there is nothing like those
French "lits-salons." Our departure from Cologne was
rather amusing. The Chef de Gare summoned us at
the last moment&mdash;all the passengers had taken their
places, the doors were shut, officials careering up and
down the platform, and <em>yet</em> the train didn't start. Various
heads were put out of the windows, and one or two
irate gentlemen inquired what they were waiting for,
and why didn't we start. Then we appeared strolling
leisurely down the platform, with a small suite of gentlemen,
officers, etc. The adieux were again a little long,
and really one man was bursting with rage, and not at
all mollified when he heard it was an Ambassador returning
to France after the Coronation; "he supposed Ambassadors
could be as punctual as anybody else, and when
an express started at 10.30, it was 10.30 for everybody."</p>

<p>We were very pleased to find Hubert and the coup&eacute;

<h2>PART II</h2>

<h2>TEN YEARS IN ENGLAND</h2>


<h3><em>To G. K. S.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Boulogne-sur-Mer</span>,<br >
August, 1883.</p>

<p>Here we are after all settled for a month at the sea. I
really needed the change and the sea-air after the fatigues
of Moscow, and I was glad to get out of my own house,
which is still crowded with boxes and huge cases labelled
<em>Waddington Couronnement</em>, which now will not be unpacked,
but go direct to London, as all the Court dresses,
gala liveries, harness, etc., will be needed there.</p>

<p>We decided just at the last moment to come here, and
consequently couldn't get a house near the big hotels in
the real "quartier des baigneurs," so we have taken one
quite the other end of the town near all the fishing boats.
They are a never-failing attraction. We love to see them
go out, and, above all, come in, when all the women,
bare-legged, and with flat baskets on their backs, go out
to meet them and bring in the fish. W. wanted us to
come here, as he was in London and thought he would
often get over from Saturday to Monday.</p>

<p>I made my first visit to the Embassy on the 15th of
August (Journ&eacute;e de l'Assomption). W. thought I had
better come over and see the house before arriving in
November to take possession. We started quite cheerfully.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_168" title="pg 168"> </a>
It was warm and bright with a good breeze&mdash;a
few white-caps, but nothing out of the way. We saw
the boats dance a little as they came in, but didn't realise
what a gale was blowing until we got on board of
ours. The wind was howling through the rigging, and
the Captain told us he couldn't start, as the wind was
blowing the water off the bar. It increased very much
while we were waiting, and several passengers left the
boat and stayed over in Boulogne until the next day.
However we had promised to go; we are fairly good sailors,
and W. had just two idle days he could give us
in London&mdash;so we started. It was certainly the worst
crossing I have ever made. The boat rolled and pitched
terribly, we shipped heavy seas all the time, and arrived
at Folkestone shivering and drenched. All the way to
London we felt little streams of water running down our
backs, and our hats were a curiosity&mdash;filled with water
like a bowl. We emptied them on the quay, but the
feathers, of course, were finished. We were met at Victoria
by two swell young secretaries, in evening dress,
with gardenias in their button-holes, who had come to
meet their Ambassadress; and I have wondered since
what impression they had of the limp, damp, exhausted
female they extracted from the reserved saloon carriage.
It was only a few minutes' drive to the Embassy at Albert
Gate, where we were received by a stout porter and
a most distinguished "groom of the chambers," dressed
in black, with a silver chain around his neck. We dined
alone in a fair-sized dining-room, with splendid Gobelin
tapestries on the walls. W. came in about 11, having
had a man's dinner with Gladstone.</p>

<p class="center small">The French Embassy, Albert Gate, London</p></div>

<p>The next day we went all over the house, which is
neither handsome nor comfortable. It is high and narrow,
like a cage, with no very large rooms, and a general
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_169" title="pg 169"> </a>
appearance of dinginess and accumulated dust. However,
the Minister has promised to paint and clean, and
to do over the small drawing-room entirely, just as I like.
Of course I shall have blue satin&mdash;you remember how I
always like blue everywhere, on me and near me. The
situation is delightful, on the Park&mdash;just at Albert Gate.
The windows and balconies of the drawing-rooms give
on the drive, and the "Row" is so near that I could
easily recognise horses and riders. The season is practically
over, but I have just seen a pretty group pass; a
lady mounted on a fine chestnut and a child on each side
of her on nice, small fat ponies; close to the little girl,
about eight years old, with her fair hair streaming down
her back from under a blue cap, rides an old groom, evidently
much pleased with his little lady's performance,
and watching her so carefully.</p>

<p>Our inspection of the house took us all the morning.
The kitchen, offices, servants' hall and rooms are enormous,
and in very bad order. I should think it would
take weeks to get it clean and habitable, and need an
army of servants to keep it so. I am thinking rather
sadly of my little hotel in Paris, so clean and bright, with
not a dark corner anywhere.</p>

<p>We went out driving in the afternoon, and I had my
first experience as Ambassadress, as the coachman drove
down Constitution Hill&mdash;a right of way reserved for
Royalties and the Corps Diplomatique. We went
straight to Mrs. Brown, the famous milliner, in Bond
Street, to get ourselves new hats, as ours were quite impossible
after our very lively passage, and the housemaid
at Albert Gate had a handsome present of two
hats with drooping feathers and a strong smell of sea
and salt. London was of course empty, but a few carriages
were in the park, and it amused us to drive about
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_170" title="pg 170"> </a>
and see all the shops, and the general look of the streets,
so different from Paris.</p>

<p>We spent our evening quietly at home looking over our
installation with W., horses, carriages, servants, and in
fact the complete organisation of a big London house,
which is so unlike a French one. I shall bring over all
my French servants and add as many English as are
necessary. I don't quite see Hubert, our French coachman,
driving about the London streets, and keeping to
the left. I should think we should have daily discussions
with all the drivers in London; however, we must try.
I wonder if I shall like being an Ambassadress, and I also
wonder how long we shall stay here. My brother-in-law
R. says perhaps two years.</p>

<p>We got back three days ago&mdash;started on a bright summer's
day. The Ambassador and secretaries came down
to the station to see us off, and W. promised to come
over and spend Sunday. We had an ideal crossing&mdash;blue
sky, bright sun, and few passengers, and, notwithstanding
our hard experience in the first passage, we are
glad to have been over and made acquaintance with the
personnel of the Embassy, also to have seen the house
and realized a little what I must bring over to give it a
look of home.</p>

<p>This morning we have the news of the Comte de
Chambord's death, and I am wondering if it will make
any political complication. However, for years past he
has only been a name&mdash;a most honourable one certainly&mdash;but
one wants more than that to deal with the present
state of France.</p>

<p>After all W. never came over. Although London was
empty, he had always some business to attend to, and on
Sunday usually went to see some friends in the country.
Last Sunday he spent with Lord Granville at Walmer,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_171" title="pg 171"> </a>
which he said was delightful. The castle so close to the
sea that the big ships passed almost under the windows;
Granville himself a charming host. He knows France
and the French well, having been a great deal in Paris
as a boy when his father was British Ambassador to
Louis Philippe (1830-4); Lord Palmerston was then
British Foreign Secretary.</p>

<p>We are very busy these days making our "pacquets,"
as we leave in three days. I am sorry to go, as I have so
much enjoyed the quiet life with the sisters and the children.
We have seen few people, as we are not in the
fashionable quarter, but we have become most intimate
with all the fishing population. The young women and
girls jibe at us when we go shrimp fishing, on terms of
perfect equality&mdash;there are no distinctions in the sea&mdash;because
we have not the sleight of hand necessary to jerk
the shining, slippery little fish into the basket from the
net. Some local swell, the Mayor, I think, came to see
me the other day, and was told I was on the beach, so
he came down and was much astonished when they
pointed out to him Madame l'Ambassadrice in a hat and
feathers, diamond ear-rings, very short skirts, and neither
shoes nor stockings, walking up to her knees in the
water with a fishing-net in one hand and a basket in the
other, and followed by her little son and niece similarly
equipped, all quite happy and engrossed with their sport.
We have one or two country visits to make, and then I
must have some time in Paris to dismantle my house
and make my preparations for London.</p>

<p>You will say I am taking up my old habits of writing
to you always from the country, but you cannot imagine
how busy I have been in London since I came
over just 2 weeks ago to-day.</p>

<p>We came down here Monday afternoon to stay with
W.'s old college friend and cousin, Charles Monk. The
house and park are charming&mdash;quantities of large, comfortable
rooms, and capital shooting. The gentlemen
brought down a great many pheasants yesterday. The
party in the house are Lord and Lady Abinger and Miss
Scarlett, Sir George and Lady Chetwode, Mr. Leveson-Gower,
a brother of Lord Granville, with a most polished
courteous manner; a Mr. Price W. Powel, and a young
Wm. Gladstone, nephew of the Premier. Monk has no
wife, and three unmarried daughters; the eldest, Julia,
does the honours very well and simply. I absolutely declined
the 9.30 breakfast and asked to have my tea sent
up to me.</p>

<p>Yesterday I came down about 12, took a little turn in
the garden until one, and at 1.30 had luncheon. Then
we went for a drive to Eastwood, the Duke of Edinburgh's
place. The house is not so large as this, but
the park is charming, with quantities of deer. We had
tea when we came in&mdash;some of the gentlemen appeared
and we dined at 8, all the ladies most gorgeous in satin,
lace, and diamonds, the girls generally in white. After
dinner we talked a little, then some of them played
whist, and the young ladies sang. This morning the
gentlemen have started again shooting, and I shall sit
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_173" title="pg 173"> </a>
in my room quite quietly until 12, which gives me an
hour and a half with the ladies before luncheon.</p>

<p>W. is off again "running for partridges," whatever that
may mean, and at 3 we go back to London. He has a
big dinner somewhere to-night. Yesterday two ladies
came over to luncheon, and in the afternoon Julia Monk
and I took a drive in the pony carriage to meet the
sportsmen, who had a very busy day. In the evening
we made a little music, Miss Scarlett played very well. I
expect to be very busy all this next week in London.
The workmen will be out of the drawing-rooms, and I
shall get all kinds of little odd tables and chairs and unpack
my own bibelots. The carriages arrive, too, and
we must decide about horses. Two English giants are
engaged as footmen, of equal height, to go on the gala
carriage, and we have our own two Frenchmen, one of
whom is very tall. He and Adela&iuml;de came down here
with us, and Adela&iuml;de is much entertained at the respect
with which she is treated. She looked quite a swell yesterday
with her black silk dress, but she says the other
maids are much more dressy, attired in black velvet and
satin and open dresses. Soon there will be nothing left
for the mistresses.</p>

<p>I will stop now, as I must be down a little earlier this
morning. I hope you will soon be settled in Washington,
and that the children will have no more scarlet fever
or measles complications.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">French Embassy, Albert Gate</span>,<br >
December 1, 1883.</p>

<p>I am gradually settling down, but everything, hours,
service, habits, servants, is so different that I still feel
rather strange. I quite sympathised with Francis, who
was already unhappy at leaving Paris and his dear "Nounou,"
and very much put out with his new German
governess who was deadly ill crossing. His woes culminated
on arriving at Albert Gate, when he was solemnly
conducted upstairs by a very tall footman to his
room (a nice large nursery and bedroom giving on the
Park), and he wept bitterly and refused to eat any dinner
or to have his coat and hat taken off. A great many people
have been to see us, and we shall have some quiet dinners&mdash;and
a shooting party at Mr. Monk's one of these
days.</p>

<p>The shooting party at Mr. Monk's was pleasant. He
has a fine large house and capital shooting. The ladies
walked about a little and followed some battues, and
everyone assembled in the drawing-room for tea. All
the women in full dress and diamonds for dinner.</p>

<p>Our Harcourt dinner was pleasant. Sir William is
charming&mdash;such an easy talker, with no pose of any kind.
It is decided that Lady Harcourt presents me to the
Queen. Lady Granville is away, and it falls upon her
as wife of the Home Secretary. Sir William had been
to Windsor, and had told the Queen of the curious coincidence&mdash;the
French Ambassadress, an American, presented
by the wife of the British Home Secretary, also an
American,<sup><a href="#fn8" id="r8">[8]</a></sup> and an amie d'enfance of Mrs. Waddington.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_175" title="pg 175"> </a>
I had some little difficulty in finding out what I was to
wear (as there is little etiquette at the English Court
upon these occasions), but they finally told me ordinary
visiting dress, so I shall wear my blue velvet. We go
down to lunch and see the Queen afterward.</p>

<p class="author">December 7, 1883.</p>

<p>I have had my audience to-day, and will write to you
at once while I still remember it all. First I must tell
you about Francis. He heard someone asking me the
other day if I had been yet to see the Queen. I saw his
face change a little, so when we were alone, he said,
tremulously, "Tu vas voir la Reine?" "Oui, mon fils."
"Est-elle toujours si m&eacute;chante?" "Mais la Reine n'est
pas m&eacute;chante, mon enfant." "Elle ne vas pas te faire
couper la t&ecirc;te?" Evidently his mind had been running
on the Tower of London, where we went the other day,
and where the block on which Anne Boleyn and Lady
Jane Grey had their heads cut off was of course shown.
When he heard I was going to see the Queen, his heart
failed him, and I had some difficulty in comforting him,
and explaining that sovereigns in these days didn't have
recourse to such extreme measures (at least in civilised
countries. I suppose the Shah of Persia wouldn't hesitate
to dispose of a head that was in his way).</p>

<p>Lady Harcourt and I started for Paddington at 1
o'clock, and got to Windsor a little before two. We
found a landau with two servants in plain black liveries
waiting for us, and we drove at once to the Castle. It
was a beautiful bright day, but snow had fallen heavily
in the country, so that the old gray walls and round towers
stood out splendidly as we drove up. We drove
through several courts and finally drew up at an entrance
where there were five servants in the royal red liveries
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_176" title="pg 176"> </a>
with crape on their sleeves (all the Queen's household are
always in mourning), a big Highlander in full dress, and
a butler in black who ushered us into a large drawing-room
with an enormous bow-window looking on the
Park. Instantly there appeared Lady Erroll, lady in
waiting, and four maids of honour. Lady Erroll shook
hands and introduced the maids of honour, who made us
low curtseys. Then came Lord Methuen&mdash;Lord in waiting&mdash;and
we went at once in to luncheon. Everything
was served on silver plate; there were four footmen and
a butler, but the repast was of the simplest description&mdash;an
ordinary English luncheon&mdash;roast mutton, fowl, pudding,
apple-tart, etc. After luncheon we talked a little,
and then Sir Henry Ponsonby appeared to give Lady
Harcourt her last instructions. It was the first time
she had presented an Ambassadress in a private
audience. Precisely at three a servant in black appeared
and said, "Will you come to see the Queen?"
Lady Harcourt, Ponsonby, and I proceeded down a
handsome long corridor filled with pictures, vitrines,
of china principally, and old furniture, to a room at
one end where a footman was standing. Sir Henry
opened the door, Lady Harcourt made a low curtsey
at the threshold, saying, "I have the honour to present
the French Ambassadress," and then immediately
backed herself out, and I found myself in the room.
I made a first low curtsey, but before I had time to make
another the Queen, who was standing in the middle of
the room with Princess Beatrice, advanced a step, shook
hands, and said, with a very pretty smile and manner,
"I am very glad to see you." She asked me to sit down,
and talked a great deal, was most gracious, asked me if I
was getting accustomed to the climate and the stairs,
whether I had seen all my "colleagues," and how many
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_177" title="pg 177"> </a>
children I had. When I said one little boy whom I had left
in London, she asked me what he was doing; I thought I
would tell her about his fears for his mother's head, so I
replied he was trembling at home until his mother should
return. She looked a little surprised, but was really
amused, and laughed when I told her his preoccupations;
said, "Poor little boy, how glad he will be to see his
mother back with her head on her shoulders."</p>

<p>Princess Beatrice took no part in the conversation.
She looked smiling and very intelligent. The Queen
was very simply dressed in black, with her white widow's
cap and veil, no ornaments, but a gold chain and pearls
around her neck, and a medallion with a portrait of a man
in uniform, whom I supposed to be Prince Albert.
I think the interview lasted about fifteen minutes. Then
the Queen arose, shook hands, and said she hoped my
husband and I would like the life in England. Princess
Beatrice shook hands&mdash;I backed myself out, and it was
over. I was very much impressed with the Queen's personality.
She is short, stout, and her face rather red,
but there is a great air of dignity and self-possession, and
a beautiful smile which lights up her whole face.</p>

<p>I never could find out any minor details in dress, as to
taking off veil, gloves, etc., but I did as I had done with
other Royalties and took off veil and gloves, which I hope
was right.</p>

<p>Lady Harcourt and Ponsonby were waiting for me in
the corridor, and seemed to think my audience had been
longer than usual&mdash;were also surprised that the Queen
made me sit down. It seems she sometimes receives
standing all the time, at a first formal presentation.</p>

<p>As we had some little time before starting for the station,
Ponsonby showed us part of the Castle. The great
halls, St. George's and Waterloo, are very fine, and it was
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_178" title="pg 178"> </a>
interesting to see the great pictures which one has always
seen reproduced in engravings&mdash;the Queen's Marriage,
Coronation, Reception of King Louis Philippe, Baptism
of the Prince of Wales, etc. One room was beautiful,
filled with Van Dycks. We went back to the station in
the same carriage, and Lady Harcourt and I talked hard
all the way home. It was certainly a very simple affair;
as little etiquette as possible, but the Castle was fine.
The old gray fortress and its towers and crenellated walls,
the home of the sovereign who lives there with little
pomp and few guards&mdash;guarded by her people, in the
same Castle, and the same surroundings as when she began
her long reign, a mere girl. When one thinks of all
the changes she has seen in other countries&mdash;kingdoms
and dynasties disappearing&mdash;one can realise what a long
wise rule hers has been. It is such a contrast to my last
Royal Audience at Moscow, which now seems a confused
memory of Court officials, uniforms, gold-laced
coats, jewelled canes (I can see one of the Chamberlains
who had an enormous sapphire at the end of his staff),
princes, peasants, Cossacks, costumes of every description,
court carriages, Russian carriages, the famous attelage
of three horses, every language under the sun,
and all jostling and crowding each other in the courts
of the Kremlin&mdash;with its wonderful churches and domes
of every possible colour from pink to green&mdash;only soldiers,
soldiers everywhere, and the people kept at a distance&mdash;very
unlike what I have just seen here.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, December 16, 1883.</p>

<p>This afternoon we have had our audience of the Prince
and Princess of Wales&mdash;W. and I together. We got
to Marlborough House a little before 4, and were shown
at once into a room on the ground floor, where we found
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_179" title="pg 179"> </a>
Miss Knollys and a gentleman in waiting. In a few
minutes Sir Dighton Probyn, comptroller of the household,
appeared and took us upstairs to a large, handsome
salon. He opened the door, and we found the Prince
and Princess standing. The room was filled with pretty
things. The Princess was dressed in blue velvet (I too&mdash;I
daresay Fromont made both dresses), and looked
charming, no older than when I had seen her in Paris
three or four years ago, and with that same beautiful
slight figure and gracious manner.</p>

<p>While the Prince and W. were talking she asked me
a great deal about Moscow and the Coronation, and
particularly if the Empress was well dressed always, as
she had been rather bothered with the quantity of
dresses, manteaux de cour, etc., that she was obliged to
have. The Prince remembered that I was the granddaughter
of Rufus King, who had been United States
Minister to London under George III. He was very
pleasant, with a charming, courteous manner. The
Princess instantly referred to Francis and his fears for
his mother's head, of which she said the Queen had told
her.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, 21st.</p>

<p>This afternoon we had tea with the Duke and Duchess
of Albany. She is a German Princess, and was rather
shy at first, but when the tea came it was easier. The
Duke is very amiable, talks easily. He looks, and is, I
believe, delicate. We have a few dinners before us, and
I am gradually getting to know all my colleagues.
Mohrenheim is Russian Ambassador; M&uuml;nster German;
and Nigra Italian. M&uuml;nster is practically an Englishman.
His second wife was Lady Harriet St. Clair, a
sister of Lord Rosslyn. He is evidently English in his
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_180" title="pg 180"> </a>
tastes and habits, rides regularly in the Park, and drives
a coach with four chestnuts that are known all over London.

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Albert Gate</span>,<br >

<p>This afternoon we had our audience from the old
Duchess of Cambridge. We found her in handsome
rooms in St. James's Palace, and one lady in waiting with
her. She was lying on a sofa&mdash;she is very old, eighty-four&mdash;has
seen and known everyone, and talks easily
both French and English. It really seemed a page of
history to listen to her. She asked us to come back, and
Lady G. told us that when she felt well, visits were a great
pleasure to her, and also that she was always glad to see
any members of the French Embassy.</p>

<p>We got home to tea&mdash;and then I had various skirmishes
with the servants. It really is difficult to make
French and English servants work together. The butler
is an Englishman, and directs all the men of the house.
It is not easy to make the Frenchmen take their orders
from him. They all want to be in direct communication
with me. There are always two together in the hall&mdash;one
Frenchman and one Englishman, and the result of
that is that when anything goes wrong, and the bell is
not answered, the Frenchman tells me he was not there,
it was the Englishman's turn; and of course the Englishman
the same&mdash;so now I have told Holmes (the butler)
to make me out a regular paper every Monday with the
men's names and their hours of service&mdash;Yves et George,
10-12; William and Charles, 12-2&mdash;I hope that will work.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_181" title="pg 181"> </a>
As to Hubert he hasn't driven me yet. He goes about
London all day in a brougham, with one of those non-descript
English servants, half French, half English, that
we got from the British Embassy in Paris. I find the
domestic part of the Embassy rather a bore, but I suppose
things will settle down. The housemaids are a
delightful institution, though I was amazed upon inquiring
one day from my own maid as to who was a young
lady with a red velvet dress, and a large hat and feathers,
I had met on the stairs, when she replied, "C'est Alice,
Madame, la seconde fille de chambre." It seems that my
maid remonstrated with her for spending her money on
clothes, to which she replied that all housemaids in big
houses dressed like that, and that she herself would be
ashamed if she dressed as plainly as my maids. The two
thrifty Frenchwomen were scandalised.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
January 9, 1884.</p>

<p>I paid a visit to-day to the Dowager Lady Stanley of
Alderley. I found her at her tea-table in her drawing-room,
with Mr. Gladstone having his cup of tea with
her, and talking easily and cheerfully about all sorts of
things (never a word of politics); no one would have
imagined that he was to make a great speech that evening
in the House. He really is an extraordinary, many-sided
man. In the course of conversation the talk fell
upon the Roman Catholic religion, and its extension in
many countries, <em>particularly in America</em>. He said, turning
to me, that a great friend of his, an American, Mr.
Hurlbert, certainly the most brilliant talker he had ever
heard, and one of the most intelligent, had told him how
much the Roman Catholic religion was gaining ground
in the Northern States of America. I rather demurred
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_182" title="pg 182"> </a>
to his statement, even though it came from Mr. Hurlbert.
His intelligence and brilliancy are undeniable, but
I should have thought his views were a little fantastic at
times. "I rather agree with you," said Mr. Gladstone;
"but I have recently had letters from my friends Bishop
P. of New York, Bishop A. of Massachusetts, and other
distinguished Churchmen in the United States, who tell
me that the Roman Catholic religion is making certain
progress; their preachers are so clever, and know so well
how to adapt themselves to the liberal views they must
have in America." We then talked some time about
the various Bishops and clergymen he knew in America,
the slight difference between the two Prayer Books, etc.
One would really have thought it was a Church of England
clergyman, who has passed all his life studying
theological questions. A few moments after something
turned his thoughts in another direction, and he was discussing
with Lady Stanley the translation into English
of an Italian sonnet which he thought was badly done.
"Too literal, really not understanding the poetry, and
the beautiful imagination of the writer." It was extraordinary.
I was rather mortified when he asked if I
knew the two Bishops. I didn't, but it is fair to say he
understood when I said how many years I had been away
from America.</p>

<p>Lady Stanley is a delightful old lady. She has seen
and known everyone worth knowing in Europe for the
last fifty years, and it is most amusing to hear her
down-right way of talking. She was killing over the "Professional
Beauties," a style of modern woman she couldn't
understand. She asked me to come in again and have a
cup of tea with her, and I shall certainly go, as one doesn't
hear such talk every day.</p>

<p>We dined with Mr. Childers, and there was a big reception
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_183" title="pg 183"> </a>
in the evening, with all the celebrities of the
Liberal party, the Harcourts, Hayters, Lord Northbrook,
Tennyson (son of the poet), and many others, but
of course in a crowd like that one can't talk. I hope I
shall remember the faces. About 11 o'clock we went on
to Lady Stanhope's, where there was a big reception of
the Conservative party. There I found the Lyttons and
some few people I knew, and many more were presented.
They were all talking politics hard; said the Ministry
couldn't last another week, as there is to be a vigorous
attack on them in both Houses on Tuesday. Everyone
says the Lyttons are going to Paris when Lord Lyons
leaves. She will be a charming Ambassadress, and he is
so fond of France and so thoroughly well up in French
literature that they will be delighted to have him in
Paris.</p>

<p>The political talk was exactly like what I have heard
so often in Paris, only in English instead of in French,
and the men talking more quietly, though they abused
one another well, and with less gesticulating. Also they
don't carry politics into private life as they do with us;
the men of opposite sides lavish abuse upon each other in
the House, but there it ends, and they meet at dinner
and chaff each other, and the wives are perfectly intimate.
In France there is a great gulf between parties,
even moderates, royalists, and republicans, and I was
astounded when I first mixed in political life in France
to see people in society turn their backs upon some perfectly
distinguished, honourable gentleman because he
had not the same opinion as themselves in politics.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Sandringham</span>,<br >
January 12, 1884.</p>

<p>We arrived this afternoon at two o'clock, and I am
writing in my room, as we have come up to bed, and the
gentlemen have retired to smoke. We came down at
2&frac12;, found a saloon carriage reserved for us, and the
Mohrenheims installed&mdash;father, mother, and daughter.
We got to Wolverton at six, one of the Prince's gentlemen
was waiting for us with two or three carriages and
footmen. We had all sent our servants and baggage by
an earlier train, as it had been suggested to us. The
house looked large and handsome as we drove up. The
party was assembled in a great hall, with a long low tea-table
at which the Princess presided. It was easy
enough, and I should think a nice party. The Goschens,
Lady Lonsdale, the Master of Magdalen, Lord Carlingford,
and others. The three young Princesses, Prince
Eddy, and the Prince were all there. We talked some
little time and then the Princess said Miss Knollys would
show us our rooms. I found two large comfortable
English rooms opening into each other, a blazing coal
fire in mine, which I immediately proceeded to demolish
as much as I could. Miss Knollys had told us not to
bring low dresses&mdash;merely open bodices.</p>

<p>We went down to the drawing-room about 8&frac12;, and
a little before 9 the Prince and Princess and Prince Albert
Victor (better known as Prince Eddy) came in.
The dinner was handsome and pleasant, footmen in royal
red liveries, men in black in culottes and silk stockings,
and a Highlander in full dress, who stood behind
the Prince's chair, and at the end of the dinner walked
solemnly round the table playing the bagpipes. The
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_185" title="pg 185"> </a>
evening was pleasant. The Prince showed us the new
ballroom just redecorated with Indian stuffs and arms,
and at 11 we went upstairs with the Princess, bidding her
good-night at the top of the stairs, and the men went to
the smoking-room.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday.</p>

<p>This morning we went to church, the ladies in an omnibus
with the Princess and her three daughters, and the
gentlemen walked across the Park, the Prince appearing
as the sermon began. It is a pretty English country
church in the grounds. In the afternoon we walked
about the grounds; I was much interested in the large
stables, where there are certainly over fifty horses.</p>

<p>We had changed our dresses after lunch for walking,
and the Princess looked marvellously young in her short
walking skirt and little toque. One could hardly believe
she was the mother of her big son, twenty-one years
old. After the walk we assembled again in the big hall
for tea, a substantial meal with every variety of muffin,
crumpet, toast, cakes and jam that can be imagined, but
it seemed quite natural to consume unlimited quantities
after our long walk. The Princess and English ladies
were in very dressy tea-gowns, velvet and satin with lace
and embroidery; Madame de Mohrenheim and I in ordinary
tailor costumes. The evening was pleasant; I remarked
the absence of the Highland piper at dinner, and
asked the Prince if he was not going to play. "Oh, no,"
he said, "not on Sunday, he certainly wouldn't; I
shouldn't like to ask him to, and if I did I am sure he
wouldn't do it." We all leave to-morrow, the Prince
going with us to London. We have enjoyed our visit
very much, the Princess always charming and lovely
to look at, and the Prince a model host, so courteous
and ready to talk about anything.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_186" title="pg 186"> </a></p>

<p class="author">Monday.</p>

<p>We got off this morning at 11 o'clock. There is one
curious custom. The Prince himself weighs everyone,
and the name and weight are written in a book. Some
of the ladies protested, but it was of no use, the Prince insisted.
One young lady weighed more than her father,
and was much mortified.</p>

<p>I went downstairs to breakfast, which I don't generally
do; I keep to my old habit of a cup of tea in my room.
It was a most informal meal. None of the Royal family
appeared, except Prince Eddy, who was going to hunt,
and his red coat made a nice patch of colour. All the
rest of us sat down anywhere, and the servants brought
the menu. We travelled up with the Prince in his private
car, and had luncheon in the car, served by two tall
footmen, and everything on silver plate and hot. The
Prince himself quite charming, talking a great deal, and
seeing that everyone had enough to eat. I should think
all servants, railway guards, and small functionaries
generally would adore him. He has always a pleasant
word and a smile.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Albert Gate</span>,<br >
January 31, 1884.</p>

<p>We have had two days in the country with the D.s at
their little hunting box at Bicester, one of the great
hunting centres. It was my first experience of an English
hunt and hunt ball, and amused me perfectly. The
house is small, with enormous stables and splendid horses.
His four in hand is well known, one of the best in England,
and the coach and servants so perfectly turned out.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_187" title="pg 187"> </a>
We have two young German secretaries, good-looking
Teutons, and two girls who have just returned from a
four months' excursion in the tropics with the Brasseys
in their beautiful yacht, the "Sunbeam."</p>

<p>We started on the coach on Tuesday at 10.30, well
wrapped up, as there were occasional showers and violent
gusts of wind, particularly when we stopped at crossroads
to see which way the hunt was going. The meet
was at Middleton Park, Lord Jersey's fine place, and the
park was a pretty sight as we drove up. A good many
people, almost all the men in pink, but not so many women
as I had expected to see. We really followed very well,
as D. knows the ground perfectly and apparently at what
spot the fox was to cross the road, which he did close to
us, followed by the whole hunt, all jumping out of the
field on to the road and back again into the other field,
very good fences, too, but the horses evidently knew just
what they had to do. We drove about till 3 o'clock, and
then went back to Middleton to have luncheon. We
found a most hospitable table, and it was funny to see
the people dropping in at intervals, some of the men in
their red coats, one or two ladies, and two or three children
who had been scampering about on ponies. Evidently
the meal had been going on for some time, and the
supply inexhaustible; we had a very good hot luncheon.</p>

<p>After lunch Lady Jersey (who is charming, very intelligent,
and interested in everything) showed us the
house. Beautiful pictures and old furniture, a massive
silver table that was the dressing table of Queen Elizabeth.
Of course we hadn't time to really see all the
interesting things in the house, as it was getting late, and
we still had a fair drive before us. Notwithstanding the
good and late luncheon we were very glad to have tea
when we got home. I certainly eat much more here, I
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_188" title="pg 188"> </a>
suppose it is the climate, and then the food is a little
different from what we are accustomed to, and I think
very good.</p>

<p>The hunt ball was really very pretty, the ballroom
well arranged with foxes' heads, brushes, etc., all the men
in pink. Everyone was "en train," and everybody of all
ages dancing. I should think W. and D. were the only
men in the room who didn't dance. They went home
about 12, but H. and I stayed until 2. We heard afterward
that the Master of Hounds was much depressed all
the evening, as he knew he must take the French Ambassadress
to supper (of course, he didn't know that I
was American born, and could speak English), and the
prospect of a long conversation in French with a woman
he didn't know filled him with dismay. However we
made friends (in English), and I hope he didn't find the
supper hour too tiresome. There are two reasons why
an Englishman hates to speak French; first, a sort of
natural timidity which they all have more or less, and
then a decided objection to doing anything he doesn't
want to do, or which bores him. This country is certainly
a Paradise for men, from the nursery days when
all the women of the household&mdash;nurses, maids, and sisters,
are slaves of the boys, to manhood, when equally
all the women do exactly what the men want, and regulate
their lives to suit the men of the family, who have
everything their own way.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
February, 1884.</p>

<p>I made my d&eacute;but in the official world last night at a
reception at Mr. Gladstone's in Downing Street. There
were four large men's dinners (and receptions afterward)
for the opening of Parliament. Lord Granville and Mr.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_189" title="pg 189"> </a>
Gladstone, Ministerial; Lord Salisbury and Sir Stafford
Northcote, "Her Majesty's Opposition."</p>

<p>The Gladstone house is small and dark (that is one
of the things that strikes me here&mdash;the rooms are so
much less lighted than in Paris), and always the chintz
covers left on the furniture, which makes the rooms look
ordinary. We found a great many people there. The
Duke of Cambridge had been dining and was presented
to us. He looks a fine old English soldier (was in uniform),
was very amiable, and spoke to me in French,
which he speaks very well. Quantities of people were
presented to me, I can't remember half the names. Almost
all the women were in black, half-high and no display
of jewels. Mrs. Gladstone is an old lady, very animated
and civil, she wears a cap, with blue ribbons, rather as I
remember Mother. I was also presented to Countess
Karolyi, Austrian Ambassadress, very handsome, and
charming manner; she speaks English as well as I do. It
seems strange to me to hear so much English spoken, it
is so long since I have been in a purely English salon.
W. brought me up various old friends of Rugby and
Cambridge days; also some of the minor diplomats, as of
course I have not yet seen all my colleagues.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Albert Gate</span>,<br >
February, 1884.</p>

<p>I am rather bewildered by the number of people I see
and the quantity of cards left at the Embassy. I shall
have to ask an English friend of mine to look over my
list and tell me who the people are, and, above all, which
cards I must return personally (or even make a personal
visit) and which can be distributed by the Chancellerie.
I drive about every afternoon for two hours leaving
cards, and as no one has regular reception days here as
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_190" title="pg 190"> </a>
in Paris, I rarely find people. We have had various dinners,
political chiefly, at Mr. Gladstone's, Lord Stanhope's,
Lord Northbrook's, a child's party at Marlborough
House, which was very pretty. Francis made
great friends with the two charming little daughters of
the Duchess of Edinburgh, and sat between them at tea,
the Duchess herself supplying them with cakes and sandwiches.</p>

<p>Yesterday there was a pleasant dinner at Lord Granville's.
Two tables of 12; one presided over by him and
one by Lady Granville. Her table was covered with red
tulips, and his with yellow&mdash;nothing but flowers on the
table. The drawing-rooms are large and handsome, and
he has some splendid pictures. One thing seems curious
to me&mdash;all the furniture at this season is covered with
ordinary chintz housses or coverings&mdash;and the effect is
strange with all the guests in full dress, diamonds and
orders, servants in powder and breeches. We would
never dream of doing it in Paris. When we have distinguished
people of any kind to dine we make our
salons as pretty as possible, and would want particularly
to uncover our handsome furniture. Here it seems they
consider that the season only begins after Easter.</p>

<p>Apropos of powder, it was rather an affair to put the
two French footmen in powder, as they of course had
never worn it or seen it. Francis was much excited at
Yves' appearance in blue velvet breeches and powder,
Yves being a young Breton, his own special attendant.
I think the maids powdered him in the laundry. However
Francis came flying downstairs holding the reluctant
Yves by the hand, to my room, saying, "Oh,
Maman, viens voir Yves, il est joli, joli!" with the youth
naturally much abashed at being so complimented in my
presence.</p>

<p>We are commanded to Windsor this evening to dine
and sleep. It is inconvenient, as we have to put off a dinner
of twenty-one people. The chef is tearing his hair, as
of course all his dinner is ready. When my maid came to
pack the trunks she had rather a flustered look; I thought
it was on account of the Windsor visit. Not at all. It
seems a friend of Juteau's (our chef), who is also a chef in
one of the great houses, heard that we were going to
Windsor, so he wrote him a note telling him that his wife
(my maid) must be well dressed and take a low or open
bodice to Windsor for their dinner. The maid was most
indignant for being supposed not to know what was right,
and answered the note saying, "she had accompanied her
mistress to every court in Europe, and knew quite well
how to dress herself."</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Windsor Castle</span>,<br >
March 1, 1884.</p>

<p>Our dinner last night went off very well, and was not
so stiff as I had expected. We took the 6 o'clock train
from Paddington, and found the Russian Ambassador,
Baron Mohrenheim, and his wife at the station. At
Windsor two or three carriages and footmen were waiting,
but no equerry as at Sandringham. We were driven
to a side door at the Castle, where two servants in plain
black were waiting, who showed us at once to our rooms.
We had a pretty apartment furnished in yellow satin, with
beautiful pictures, principally portraits; a small salon with
a bedroom on each side, bright fires burning, and a quantity
of candles. They brought us tea, beautifully served
all on silver, with thin bread and butter (no muffins or
toast), and almost at the same moment Sir John Cowell,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_192" title="pg 192"> </a>
Master of the Household, came to pay us a visit. He
told us who the party was, said dinner was at 8.45, that a
page would come and tell us at 8.30, and that we should
assemble in the great corridor. Quite punctually at 8.30
they notified us, and we proceeded down the long corridor,
W. in black breeches and stockings (no order, as
he hadn't the L&eacute;gion d'Honneur, and couldn't wear a
foreign order), I in white brocaded velvet and diamonds.
We found the party assembled, the Mohrenheims; Lord
and Lady Kimberley; Nigra, Italian Ambassador; Lady
Churchill (who was in waiting); Lord Kenmare (Lord
Chamberlain), and Lord Dalhousie (Lord in waiting)
and one or two other men. We moved up to a door just
opposite the dining-room, and about 9 the Queen came
with the Duchess of Edinburgh and Princess Beatrice.
She shook hands with me and Madame Mohrenheim;
bowed very graciously to all the others, and passed at
once into the dining-room alone. Mohrenheim followed
with the Duchess of Edinburgh; Nigra with Princess
Beatrice; W. with Madame Mohrenheim; and Kimberley
took me. The table was handsome, covered with
gold and silver plate, quantities of servants in red livery,
plain black, and two Highlanders in costume behind the
Queen's chair.</p>

<p>The conversation was not very animated. The Queen
herself spoke little, and the English not at all&mdash;or so low
that one couldn't understand them&mdash;however, my Ambassador
couldn't stand that long, so he began talking
most cheerfully to the Duchess of Edinburgh about Moscow,
Kertch, and antiquities of various kinds, and as the
Duchess is clever and inclined to talk, that corner became
more lively. I can't say as much for our end. I think
most Englishmen are naturally shy, and the presence of
Royalty (the Queen above all) paralyses them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width:100%"><a href="#illustrations"><img src="images/illus220.jpg" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Windsor Castle" id="illus220" title="Windsor Castle"> </a>
<p class="center small">Windsor Castle</p></div>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_193" title="pg 193"> </a></p>

<p>After dinner, which was quickly served, we all went
out as we had come in, and the Queen held a short cercle
in the corridor, in the small space between the two doors.
She stood a few minutes talking to the two Princesses,
while she had her coffee (which was brought for her
alone on a small tray), and then crossed over to Madame
Mohrenheim and talked a little. She sat down almost
immediately, Madame Mohrenheim remaining standing.
She then sent for me, Lord Dalhousie summoning us all
in turn. She was very gracious, saying that she could not
yet stand or walk, which worried her very much&mdash;asked
me a great deal about my life in London, did I find everything
very different from Paris, and had I found little
friends and a school for Francis? The conversation was
not easy. She sat on rather a low chair, and I standing
before her had to bend down always. She was dressed in
black, with her usual little cap and veil, opal necklace,
diamonds and orders. While she was talking to the
others the two Princesses moved about and talked to us.
It was pleasant&mdash;the whole cercle lasted about an hour.
The Queen and Princesses retired together, all shaking
hands with me and Madame Mohrenheim, and bowing to
the others. We finished the evening in the drawing-room
with the household, staying there about half an
hour, and a little after eleven we broke up. W. has gone
off to smoke&mdash;at the extreme end of the Castle, as the
Queen hates smoke and perhaps doesn't know that anyone
dares smoke here&mdash;and I am writing with about
twelve tall wax candles on my table.</p>

<p>It is a bright moonlight night, and the Castle looks
enormous. A great mass of towers, vaulted gateways,
walled courts, and the beautiful grass slopes that look
quite green in the moonlight. The lights at the far end
seem like twinkling tapers. It is certainly a magnificent
Royal residence.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_194" title="pg 194"> </a></p>

<p class="author">Saturday, March 1884.</p>

<p>We got back for lunch, leaving the Castle at 10.30.
We breakfasted with the household at 9.30; no ceremony,
people coming in as they liked, and sitting down
anywhere. We loitered a little in the corridor until it
was time to start, looking at the pictures, portraits, and
the curious cabinets and the bits of old furniture which
are interesting.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Albert Gate</span>,<br >
March 14, 1884.</p>

<p>To-day was our first Drawing-room, and we turned out
in great force, I had three secretaries' wives. We had
out our two carriages. W. and I in the gala carriage
with Count de Florian, Secretary of Embassy, Hubert
driving us, and two English giants behind; then came
the landau with merely one footman on the box, all
in full dress livery, blue breeches, silk stockings, and
powdered wigs. There was a great display of troops,
and a crowd waiting on the pavement outside the door
at the Embassy to see us start. There are no porte-coch&egrave;res
in London, so you go straight out into the
street to get your carriages, and a carpet is kept in the
hall, which is rolled down the steps every time you go
out. The streets were crowded as we came near Buckingham
Palace.</p>

<p>We entered the Palace by a side entrance, leaving our
wraps in one of the rooms, and went up the great staircase,
which was a pretty sight. Quantities of plants and
flowers and a long procession of women with handsome
Court dresses, splendid tiaras, and a few men in uniform&mdash;of
course women preponderate. We walked through
various rooms all filled with Court functionaries, officers
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_195" title="pg 195"> </a>
in uniform, and finally arrived in the large salon opening
into the Throne-Room where all the Corps Diplomatique
and English people who had the entr&eacute;e were
assembled. Countess Granville, wife of the Foreign
Secretary, Earl Granville, looked most distinguished,
tall and fair, in black with a handsome tiara. Countess
Karolyi, Austrian Ambassadress, was beautiful in her
Hungarian costume and splendid jewels. The Russians
also most picturesque in their national court dress, red
velvet trains heavily embroidered in gold, white veils
spangled with gold, and the high head-dress (kakoshnik)
in velvet studded with jewels.</p>

<p>When the doors were opened the Foreign Secretary
and his wife passed first and took up their station close
beside the Princess of Wales, to name the members of
the Corps Diplomatique. Then the Master of Ceremonies
gave his hand to the Doyenne&mdash;the Austrian
Ambassadress&mdash;her train was spread out by two pages,&mdash;and
they entered the Throne-Room, making low bows
or curtseys on the threshold. One makes 3 curtseys; one
on entering the room, one half way and a third as one
gets close to the Princess. We followed quickly, I with
my ladies coming directly behind the Russians. The
Court was small&mdash;Princess of Wales, Princess Beatrice,
Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge. The Princess,
a charming graceful figure dressed in dark velvet with
coloured embroideries and jewels and orders; Princess
Beatrice in mauve, and the two Princes in uniform of
English Field Marshal. The Princesses shook hands
with us chefesses and bowed to the young ladies&mdash;the
Princes the same. There was no sort of trouble about
the train; they are down only for a moment, just as you
pass the Queen or Princess&mdash;a chamberlain picks them
up most adroitly, puts them in your arm, and one never
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_196" title="pg 196"> </a>
gives them a thought. As soon as we had passed the
group of Princes we turned into a deep window recess
and stood there until the end. That was most amusing,
as we faced the door and saw everyone come in. It
amused and interested me extremely to see how differently
people passed. Most of the women looked well,
their fresh, fair skins standing the test&mdash;and a pretty
severe one it is&mdash;of full dress, white feathers and veil at
three in the afternoon of a cold March day. Many had
been dressed since 12, first sitting a long time in their
carriages, and then waiting a long time in the drawing-room
at the Palace, until their turns came. They were
generally timid and nervous when they passed&mdash;some
bracing themselves as if they were facing a terrible ordeal,
some racing past very quickly, forgetting to take their
trains in their arms, and pursued down the room by an
impatient chamberlain, and some, especially the d&eacute;butantes,
making carefully and conscientiously the low
regulation curtsey to each Prince, and trembling with
shyness. When the last person had passed the Court
turned and made us bows and curtseys&mdash;the Princess'
half curtsey is charming&mdash;and it was over. We all got
away quickly.</p>

<p>The great hall was an interesting sight, filled with
women and uniforms of every kind, and a band playing
in the great square. We had the usual "Drawing-room
tea" to show our dresses. I wore the blue embroidered
Court dress I had made for Moscow, with blue feathers
and diamond tiara. All the English women wear white
feathers and veils, which naturally does not suit everyone,
particularly if they are not well put on. Some of
the coiffures were almost eccentric, one rather high
feather, and a long one very low running down one's
back. The young men were pleased, as they had many
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_197" title="pg 197"> </a>
compliments for our carriages and liveries. We were the
only Embassy that had out two carriages.</p>


<h3><em>To G. K. S.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
May, 1884.</p>

<p>We went to the Derby this morning with Lord Cork.
I had never been, and W. not for many years. We went
down by train&mdash;(special, with the Prince and racing coterie)
and I enjoyed the day. We were in the Jockey
Club box, and it was a curiosity to see the crowd on the
lawn, packed tight, and every description of person, all
engrossed with the race, and wildly interested in the
horses. There was almost a solemn silence just before
the Derby was run. This time there was a tie, which
is rare, I believe. It was rather amusing driving home
from Victoria, as all the balconies along the road were
decorated, and crowded with people, but I believe the
great fashion of driving down had almost disappeared.
Nearly everyone now goes down by train.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
June 28, 1884.</p>

<p>This morning H. and I went to the second meet of the
Coaching Club on D.'s coach. It was a pretty sight; a
bright beautiful morning and Hyde Park crowded with
equipages, riders, and pedestrians&mdash;quantities of pretty
women all much dressed, principally in white, with hats
trimmed with flowers, and light parasols. The tops of
the coaches looked like flower beds. Everyone engrossed
with the teams, criticising and admiring with
perfect frankness. The fly-drivers were killing, knew
all the horses, and expressed themselves freely on the way
they were handled.</p>

<p>We drove through the Park, and then on to Richmond
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_198" title="pg 198"> </a>
(not all the coaches), where we breakfasted at the "Star
and Garter." The breakfast was good, and at dessert we
had "Maids of Honour," the famous cakes that one always
gets there. We walked about the Park a little after
breakfast; it was delightful under the big trees, and then
mounted our coach again and went back by Hurlingham
to see a polo match. The road was crowded and driving
very difficult, but D. is a capital whip, and I wasn't in the
least nervous, though sometimes it did seem as if the
bit of road they left us was rather narrow. However D.
drove straight on without slackening&mdash;and they do make
way for a coach. I think it is a sort of national pride in
a fine team.</p>

<p>Hurlingham is very pretty and there were quantities
of people there. We saw very well from the top of the
coach, and I must say the game was beautifully played.
Of course the men all rode perfectly, but the ponies were
so clever, quite as keen as the riders, and seemed to know
all about it. We got back to the Embassy about 8, and
happily had no one to dinner, but sat on the balcony all
the evening, W. smoking, and talking about his conference,
which is not going smoothly. The English are
stiff, and the people at home unreasonable. I can't imagine
how French and English can ever work together&mdash;they
are so absolutely unlike.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, July, 1884.</p>

<p>W. went to Paris this morning and H. and I are left
to our own devices. I dined alone at the Speaker's and
it was pleasant. After dinner we went down to the
terrace and walked and sat about. It was so warm
that we all sat there with bare arms and necks. It was so
pretty; boats passing on the river, all the bridges lighted,
and so cool and dark on the terrace that one could
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_199" title="pg 199"> </a>
hardly recognise the people as they walked up and down.
I went back to the Embassy to get H., and we went to
Devonshire House, where there was a big reception&mdash;all
the world there, and the house very handsome, a fine
staircase; Lord Hartington receiving us, as the Duke is
an old man and couldn't stand the fatigue.</p>

<p>This morning we have the news of the fall of Khartoum
and the murder of Gordon. W. is in the country
trying horses, so I put on my hat and went out into the
Row to hear what was going on. It was crowded with
people talking and gesticulating. The Conservatives
furious, "such a ministry a disgrace to the country," and
a tall man on a handsome chestnut, talking to Admiral
C. most energetically, "I am a moderate man myself, but
I would willingly give a hand to hang Gladstone on this
tree." They are much disgusted&mdash;and with reason.</p>

<p class="author">Monday, February 23, 1885.</p>

<p>It seems to be my week, Dear Gertrude, so I will at
any rate begin this morning. We are now in full tide
of dinners and routs, which last is the most frightful species
of entertainment that the human mind has ever devised.
They consist of 400 or 500 people packed close
in a house which holds about 150&mdash;so warm in the rooms
that you almost stifle&mdash;and so cold on the staircase and
halls where the door is always open wide that I always
wonder how I can escape without a fluxion de poitrine.
We had a banquet ourselves last Tuesday, Harcourts
M&uuml;nsters, Corks, etc., followed by a mild dance, which
was however successful, as Pourtal&egrave;s, who is a gay little
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_200" title="pg 200"> </a>
fellow, led a spirited cotillon, and there were 22 couples.
I performed 2 quadrilles, which, naturally, is the extent of
my dancing now, unless I take a stray turn with an old
partner.</p>

<p>Of course the great excitement has been the departure
of the Guards for Egypt, as it takes the husbands, sons,
and brothers of half London away. It does seem such a
useless campaign and sacrifice of human life.</p>

<p>There was a child's party at Marlborough House on
Friday afternoon which was very successful. Mimi and
I were bidden, or <em>commanded</em>, as the correct phrase is,
at 4 o'clock, so we took ourselves off, he in his white
sailor suit, with blue collar, and I in blue velvet. Both
Prince and Princess were very amiable, and the Duchess
of Edinburgh was very good to Mimi, as she always is,
making him sit by her daughters to see the conjuror, and
at her table for tea. The children had their tea in
the dining-room, with a great many little round tables,
we had ours with the Princess. It is very informal, she
always makes it herself, and everyone sits down. The
Princess Louise was also there, looking very nice, and
such a pretty figure. After the tea the children had a
fine romp, ending with a most animated Sir Roger de
Coverley, in which all the Princes&mdash;I mean the 2 younger
ones, Prince Eddy and Prince George&mdash;joined, and
all the Aides-de-Camp. We didn't leave till 7&mdash;and the
afternoon was rather long, but still I must say I enjoyed
myself.</p>

<p>Yesterday we had a pleasant dinner at Lady Hayter's&mdash;a
Liberal political salon. She has big dinners&mdash;receptions
every Saturday. It was pleasant at first, until many
more people came than the house would hold, but that is
what the "Ma&icirc;tresse de Maison" particularly aims at.</p>

<p>Everyone here sympathises with Lowell on the death
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_201" title="pg 201"> </a>
of his wife. She was so very peculiar. I wrote him a
little note, as he was always very amiable to me and complimentary
about Father and Grandpa. This evening
we had a dinner at Julia, Lady Tweeddale's, who is
chaperoning her niece, Sir Robert Peel's daughter.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday.</p>

<p>I couldn't finish last evening, so take up my letter
now at 7 o'clock, while I am waiting to dress for
dinner. It is a quiet dinner at the Miss Monks'&mdash;two
cousins, maiden ladies&mdash;and I shall wear a high dress,
which is much easier to get into. Our dinner last
night was pleasant and swell&mdash;Duke and Duchess of
Leeds, Lord and Lady Delawarr, Lord and Lady Claud
Hamilton (she a beauty, with a fine figure; he an
attractive Irishman, son of the Duke of Abercorn) and
others. They danced afterwards, and we stayed till 12
o'clock. The pose of the fast young married set is not
to dance. There is no one to dance with, the Guards
are gone. The Row was lovely this morning, like a
May day, everybody out. I hope to begin to ride again
next week. I am in treaty for a very handsome chestnut,
if the man will come down a little in his price.</p>

<p>We have been to-day to the House of Lords to hear
Lord Salisbury speak and the vote of censure passed.
The House was full&mdash;the Prince and Duke of Cambridge
there. Lord Salisbury spoke well; very calm, very nasty
for his adversaries, and as he had the beau r&ocirc;le he was
much applauded. The defence was weak, the orator
feeling evidently that his cause was a bad one, and the
temper of the House against him. I should think Lord
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_202" title="pg 202"> </a>
Salisbury would be a most unpleasant adversary, though
always perfectly courteous in manner.</p>

<p>This is my week again, Dear Jan, and I will begin to-day.</p>

<p>We are going on in a wildly dissipated manner. Last
week was very full. We went to a very pretty ball given
by the Artillery Company of London to the Prince and
Princess. The Duke of Portland, a young fellow, is
colonel of the regiment, and the thing was very well
done. Both Prince and Princess danced several times.
The supper was very pretty. When it was ready everybody
made a line all down the ballroom, and then
the procession, with the Princess first and the Duke of
Portland, then the Prince with me and various other
Princes and swells, walked down the long room, the band
playing the "British Grenadiers," and all the people bowing
and curtseying. The Royal party supped on a platform
and there were 1,000 people seated at supper at
long narrow tables, everyone looking hard at the Princess.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, 12th.</p>

<p>I never got any further and never have had time since,
but I will begin this morning and finish my letter this
evening. To-day is the first Drawing-room of the season.
As Countess Karolyi doesn't come, I am the
Doyenne, and shall have to go in first, led by Sir Francis
Seymour. Mr. Lowell has asked me to take his
presentation. However there is only Bessie V. R.,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_203" title="pg 203"> </a>
Eugene's daughter, who is pleased at being presented
by an Ambassadress. She will also see the Diplomatic
Corps pass. I wish Jess were here, and so does
Adela&iuml;de, who would be so delighted to dress her.
Last night we had a very pleasant dinner at Lady
Jersey's. Such a handsome woman was there, the young
Duchess of Montrose. After dinner we went to the
Speaker's reception, which was crowded, but rather
amusing&mdash;such funny looking people and such dresses.</p>

<p>I am overrun with artists. There are several French
artists of all kinds here, and I must make them play
once, so I have decided upon next Friday afternoon. It
is my day and I shall invite all the musical and entertaining
people I know, as of course they all wish to be
heard. One girl really does play very well on the violin,
and wants me very much to sing with her accompaniment,
which, naturally, I shan't, and another sings, not
very remarkably, and a third, Marie Dubois, plays really
beautifully&mdash;premier prix du Conservatoire. I will write
you all about it when it is over.</p>

<p class="author">7 o'clock.</p>

<p>Well, we have performed the Drawing-room&mdash;it was
short, not more than an hour and a quarter, and I must
say very few pretty faces or pretty dresses&mdash;Bessie V. R.
looked very well, very distinguished. She followed directly
behind me&mdash;even in front of my secretaries' wives,
and was the third lady in the room. There were quite a
lot of Princes&mdash;Prince and Princess of Wales, Prince
Waldemar of Denmark, Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh,
Duke of Cambridge and Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar.
Mme. de Bylandt, wife of the Dutch Minister,
presented Mme. and Mlle. de Brenen, Dutch ladies, both
mother and daughter handsome and well dressed. The
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_204" title="pg 204"> </a>
Princess looked charming in white and gold. The Duchess
of Edinburgh had a dark green velvet train. We
all came back here to tea and had various visitors to
look at the dresses, including Baron Pawel-Rammingen,
husband of Princess Frederica of Hanover, who also
happened in and was much amused at finding such an
&eacute;talage of trains&mdash;happily we have nothing this evening.
Next week is the marriage of the Duke of B.'s daughter.
It is to be at Westminster Abbey and very swell, the
Prince and Princess going. There is to be a party
Tuesday night, where all her jewels are to be shown,
which they say are splendid. I am sorry not to go, but
we have a dinner and a dance ourselves. I shall go to
the wedding. She is small and quiet&mdash;rather shy. I
don't know whether one of those mysterious changes
will take place which one sees sometimes after marriage&mdash;coronets
and trains do a great deal. I must finish,
as I have of course several notes to answer. I hate it
so, when people wait for answers. I suppose I shall
have a fine account of the Inauguration from Gertrude.
I hope the girls have enjoyed it.</p>

<h3><em>To G. K. S.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
March 12, 1885.</p>

<p>I went yesterday to say good-bye to Lady R. They
are leaving for Bombay, where he is named Governor.
It is for five years; I think I should be unwilling to go
so far, and to such a trying climate, but she seems plucky
enough and will certainly do well.</p>

<p>Francis and I were driving up Constitution Hill yesterday
just as the Queen arrived, so we had a very good
look at her. She was in an open carriage with Princess
Beatrice and her fianc&eacute;, Prince Henry of Battenberg
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_205" title="pg 205"> </a>
(such a handsome man), and the usual escort of Life-Guards.
She recognised me perfectly, and always has a
gracious bow and smile. Just before she came one of our
English friends who was walking about with her daughter
(a young girl who had never seen the Queen) suddenly
spied me (as mine was the only carriage that was
allowed to stand) and asked me if she and her daughter
could get into the carriage with me, as that would be such
a good chance for the girl to see the Queen. I of course
was delighted to have them, as Francis and I were alone,
and the girl saw perfectly. So many English people, except
those who go to Drawing-Rooms, never get a chance
to see the Queen at all.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, March.</p>

<p>We have been to Church this morning at Westminster
Abbey, such a magnificent service. The Dean always
gives us seats, and I love the music, the boys sing very
well, and the hymns are grand as they echo through the
fine old church. In every direction there is some historical
souvenir; tombs, old glass windows, tattered flags,
crests,&mdash;all England's past. We walked home through
Green Park, and it is curious to notice the absence
of equipages&mdash;so many English people don't take out
their carriages on Sunday (to rest the horses and let the
servants go to church), again such a striking contrast to
Paris, where every kind of conveyance is out on that day.
I think of the little grocer near H. who goes out every
Sunday as soon as it is at all warm with his whole family
and 2 or 3 dogs in his little covered cart. All the
"Soci&eacute;t&eacute;" is out also; at the big concerts, reviews, races,
etc. Sunday is the great Parisian holiday.</p>

<p>This morning before starting I had my head out of
the window on the other side of the Embassy, looking
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_206" title="pg 206"> </a>
at the Guards pass on their way to the little church just
behind the Embassy in Knightsbridge. They came
down from the barracks at a swinging pace, a fine body
of men, the sergeants with their canes, and several officers.
The band, a very good one, plays all the time (to-day
they marched to the French tune "Le P&egrave;re Victoire"),
and takes up its station, always playing, at the door of
the church. They play until the last man files in, then
suddenly the music stops, and the band goes in also. It
always interests the French servants immensely, the two
maids had their heads out too, and said to me just now,
"C'est bien beau, Madame, quel dommage que cela ne
se passe pas comme cela chez nous." The service in the
Guards' Chapel at Wellington Barracks is also a fine one,
the chapel filled with soldiers, a mass of red (as one sees
only their tunics), and the singing very good&mdash;a little
loud sometimes when it is a favourite hymn and all
join in.</p>

<p>We have had our second "Drawing-room" to-day, and
were asked to come in "demi-deuil," as it was the first
time the Queen had received any of the Corps Diplomatique
since the Duke of Albany's death. There are
always more people when the Queen holds the Drawing-room,
as it is the only chance so many of her subjects
ever have of seeing her. She rarely comes to London,
and stays only two or three days. She was dressed with
her little closed diamond crown, the blue ribbon of the
Garter, and many diamonds. I thought the black becoming
generally.</p>

<p>At our dinner to-day at Lord A.'s Mr. Campbell was
next to me, and told me he was most anxious to be recalled
to the French Ambassador, that he had been his
fag at Rugby, and had never seen him since. Of course
they made acquaintance again after dinner, and plunged
into all sorts of recollections of their school days. The
other men who were smoking with them said the talk was
most interesting and curious, as their careers in after life
had been so very different. At every turn W. finds
someone who had been at Rugby or Cambridge with
him.</p>

<p>This morning it is pouring, so I gave up the Oxford
and Cambridge boat race. W. and Count de Florian
started all with light blue rosettes (Cambridge). W.
was on the umpire boat. Cambridge won easily, which
was of course a great pleasure to him (having rowed
himself so many years ago in the Cambridge crew),
in the evening. He said he was so much cheered when
he got up to speak&mdash;young men standing on chairs to
see him&mdash;that he had to wait some time before he could
begin. He is certainly the only foreign Ambassador that
ever rowed in the Cambridge eight. He was quite pleased
when he came home, so many old memories of happy
boyish days had been brought back. We talked for
some time after dinner, and recalled all sorts of Cambridge
experiences&mdash;once when the Queen came with
Prince Albert to Cambridge the students were all assembled
in the court-yard as her carriage drove up. It
had been raining, and the Queen hesitated a moment in
getting out, as the ground was wet and there was mud.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_208" title="pg 208"> </a>
Instantly W. had his gown off and on the ground, the
others followed his example, and she walked over a carpet
of silk gowns the few steps she had to make. W. said he
had never forgotten her smile as she bowed and thanked
them.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">The Garth, Bicester</span>,<br >
Sunday, April 19, 1885.</p>

<p>I believe this is my week, Dear Jan. I am staying
here at a queer little hunting box in Oxfordshire with
Hilda Deichmann (n&eacute;e de Bunsen). It is literally an
enormous stable, with a cottage attached, but they have
added a story and wings and it is the most wonderful-looking
place, very low&mdash;but comfortable. W. went
off to Paris Sunday, and I came down here last Saturday
with Mimi. He is very fond of the children&mdash;a big boy
of 11 and a girl of 7&mdash;and has enjoyed himself thoroughly.
We feel awfully cut up at Pont&eacute;coulant's death.
He has been such a good friend to us, and so completely
associated with all our political life. It seems incredible
that a strong man should be carried off like that in
4 days from a cold. Henrietta will miss him awfully, as,
now that we are so much away he was always there and
attending to anything she wanted done.</p>

<p>Of course everyone is talking and speculating about
the Anglo-Russian question. W. thinks the English
must fight, and that they will. I think this government,
with Gladstone at its head, will never make up their minds
to fight seriously or in time, judging from the way the
Soudan campaign has been conducted.</p>

<p>We have been driving all over the country, which is
charming, flat, but all grass (Oxfordshire is a regular
hunting country), and since three days the weather has
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_209" title="pg 209"> </a>
been enchanting. Yesterday we made a lovely excursion
to Blenheim on Deichmann's coach. We picked
up 2 neighbours, nice, pretty English girls, and had a
beautiful drive over the downs. Mimi had never been on
a coach before, and was in a wild state of delight when
all four horses galloped up the hills, and they blew the
horns at all the railway stations and passing thro' the
villages. I had forgotten how magnificent Blenheim was.
The house is rather dismantled, as the present Duke has
sold all the books and some of the handsomest pictures,
but there are plenty left&mdash;Van Dycks, Rubens, etc., and
the rooms and halls are splendid. There were lots of
portraits of the Dukes and Duchesses, from the great
Duke down, some curiously like the present Churchills,
particularly the women. When we had finished
sauntering through the house, we drove about the park
looking for a shady place to lunch, and then established
ourselves; the horses were taken out, the lunch basket
opened, and we had a very good lunch on the top of the
coach. We drove back through Woodstock and
stopped for tea at Dashwood Park, one of the great
places of the country. They gave us tea, with every
variety of toast, cake, and bread that can be imagined,
in a beautiful room as large as a church, opening
on a stone terrace, and the most lovely (English)
views of grass meadows and trees, stretching miles
away. There were quantities of family portraits there,
too, but we hadn't time to see them. We got home at
7 o'clock, rather exhausted, but having had a lovely
day.</p>

<p>I began my letter this morning before breakfast and
will finish it now. The children are off to the woods with
the German tutor after primroses, but it is too warm
for us&mdash;so we shall take a walk after tea. I am very
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_210" title="pg 210"> </a>
fond of Hilda Deichmann. She is very clever&mdash;knows
a great many things&mdash;draws well, paints well, is a good
musician, and is womanly and practical. We fraternised
from the first moment. We are going back to London
to-morrow afternoon. Mimi's school begins on Tuesday,
and I think he has had a good outing for the present.
I haven't an idea what we shall do this winter.
Perhaps when W. comes back he will have some plans.
With this new Ministry, it is difficult to make any. I
am so afraid of their proposing some beastly measure,
like the exile of the Orl&eacute;ans Princes, or something of
that kind to be popular before the election. The Wales'
visit to Ireland seems to be progressing most delightfully
and much more quietly than people thought. He has
such wonderful charm of manner. I should think personal
contact with him would always work wonders. I
must stop now or my letter will not go this afternoon.</p>

<p>We had yesterday a typical London <em>Season</em> evening.
We dined at Lady Vivian's&mdash;a large, handsome dinner,
everybody rather in a hurry to get away, as there were
two big parties; Lady Derby's in St. James's Place, and
Lady Salisbury's in Arlington Street. We drove down
Piccadilly with much difficulty, getting along very slowly
in spite of our "white card," but finally did arrive at Lady
Derby's. The staircase was a mass of people struggling
to get in, an orchestra playing, and about 1,200 people
in rooms that would hold comfortably about half. Of
course on such occasions one doesn't talk. We spoke
to our host and hostess, were carried on by the crowd,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_211" title="pg 211"> </a>
made the tour of the rooms and got down again with
much waiting and jostling, as there were two currents
coming and going. However, we did finally get our carriage,
and then with many stops and very slowly, got to
Arlington Street, where apparently the same people were
struggling on the staircase, the same orchestra playing,
and just as big a crowd (I should think the whole Conservative
party), for though the house is larger they had
invited more people, so the result was practically the
same. We did exactly the same thing, exchanged a few
words with Lady Salisbury, made the tour, and came
home. We were two hours performing these two receptions,
but I suppose it was right to do it once. However,
the English certainly enjoy the sight, and don't
mind the waiting. Lady Jersey, who is a grandmother,
told me this afternoon she had bored herself to death
last night. "Why did you go?" I said, "you must know
these big political parties by heart." "Oh, I like the
parties," she said; "only I didn't get to either," and then
she explained her evening. She started alone in her carriage
at 10 o'clock for Lady Derby's, was kept waiting
an interminable time in Piccadilly, and when she finally
did reach Lady Derby's door, a friendly link-man advised
her not to go in as everybody was coming away,
and she would never get up the stairs, so she turned back
and proceeded to Arlington Street. She had the same
crowd, the same long wait, and when she arrived at Lady
Salisbury's the party was over, and no one could possibly
get in. It was then midnight, and she drove home, having
passed her whole evening since 10 o'clock alone in
her brougham in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>This afternoon we have had a conf&eacute;rence "sur Racine"
in the big drawing-room. A good many people came
and apparently listened, and I hope it may do the young
lady good. Mlle. de B. wishes to get up classes of
French literature for ladies, but I hardly think it will
succeed here in the season; on a bright day no one will
shut herself up in a smallish room to hear about Racine,
Moli&egrave;re, etc. I was amused by one of our colleagues
whom I invited. He refused promptly, "he really
couldn't do that even for me. He hadn't thought about
Racine since he left school, and hadn't felt it a blank in
his life." Mlle. de B. did it very well; she sat on a little
platform with a table in front of her, and all the swells in
red and gilt arm-chairs facing her, and looking at her
hard. She was a little nervous at first, but soon got over
that, and her language was good and well chosen, she
knew her subject perfectly, and spoke in a pretty clear
voice. This was the invitation:&mdash;</p>

<p>We are having most beautiful weather, Dear, and our
morning rides are delightful. If only the Park was a
little bigger. We always get a good gallop on the other
side by the Marble Arch, but it is small, and one goes
round and round. When I ride with W. we generally
make three or four turns as fast as we can go, he hates
to dawdle. When I ride with the military attach&eacute;, or
some other friends, we do the Row, and amble up and
down, talking to the people walking as well as the riders.
The children always delight in scampering along on their
ponies, and they certainly begin young. A friend of
ours, who has a nice sturdy boy of about six, was wondering
whether he should begin with his child on a narrow
pony, thinking he was still rather young, so he consulted

<p>To-day we have had a very long Drawing-room held
by the Queen, which of course attracts everyone. She
rarely stays more than an hour, just long enough to receive
the Corps Diplomatique and the people who have
the entr&eacute;e. The Queen looked very well, merely shook
hands with me, but talked some little time to W., said
she had enjoyed her stay at Aix-les-Bains so much, and
that everything had been done to make her comfortable.
I watched her while she was talking and I never saw
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_214" title="pg 214"> </a>
a smile make such a difference in a face. Hers is quite
beautiful and lights up her whole face. It was tiring
to-day&mdash;unending. Lord R. told me there were 400
presentations, and at the end said about 1,200 people
had passed. They say the Queen is sometimes made sick
by the quantity of people curtseying before her&mdash;the
constant movement of the people bending down and rising
has the same effect upon her as the waters of the
sea. I can understand it.</p>

<p>The long Drawing-room to-day was a god-send to
Lady A.,&mdash;one of Lord C.'s daughters. She is a "d&eacute;butante,"
had a very pretty new dress, and was much excited
over her presentation, had started very early with
her mother so as to see the Queen (who stays only a
short hour). The early start and the long waiting in the
row of carriages and also the ante-room, exhausted her
absolutely. She was sick and faint; they did all they
could, brought her brandy, put her near an open window&mdash;nothing
did any good. She had to retire from the
room, go downstairs, have her dress cut open (there was
a knot in the lace and they couldn't unlace her bodice),
and remained extended on a sofa in the hall&mdash;train, veil,
feathers, all in a heap. After a rest of two hours, and a
cup of tea (procured with great difficulty, as there is no
buffet on these occasions) she felt better, and her mother
hearing from a friend upstairs, who was "de service," that
the Drawing-room was still going on, was most anxious
that the girl should pass, so they arranged her veil, hair,
and feathers as well as they could, tied the bodice of her
dress, and filled in the intervals with some bits of tulle
cut from her veil. She passed, and I don't believe anyone
noticed anything wrong with her dress, and she was
so thankful not to have to go through that long waiting
again. It is a most fatiguing day for those who haven't

the entr&eacute;e, as they must sit so long in their carriages in
the file.</p>

<p>We came down yesterday to this most beautiful old
place. A large Elizabethan castle, standing rather high,
with courts and terraces in every direction. We found
Lady Salisbury at her tea-table on the terrace with a
lovely view of park and woods on all sides. Various
members of the family and house-party sauntered up,
some of the young ladies in their habits, having been
riding; and some guests having walked up from the
station, which is quite near at the end of the Park.
After an hour's talk Lady Salisbury took me to my
room (miles away through the long hall and up a
great staircase), and told me dinner was "easy 8."
The room is large, all panelled in oak which has become
almost black with age, an enormous bed (they
have always had their sheets made especially for these
beds for more than 200 years, in Germany I think, as no
ordinary sheets could cover more than half). The beds
are very long and almost square. They would easily
hold Brigham Young and all his wives. Do you remember
the picture in Mark Twain? Mine was so high I had
to take a footstool to clamber into it. W.'s room, next,
about the same. We went downstairs at 8.10 and certainly
didn't dine until after 8&frac12;. We were about 30 in
the great dining-room, a splendid hall with portraits of
Queen Elizabeth (one in fancy dress, most curious with
bright red hair), Henry VIII, Mary Queen of Scots, etc.
We played cards in the evening and broke up rather
early. This morning Lady Salisbury showed me the
house&mdash;most interesting, full of treasures and memories,
a great library with all sorts of letters from the time of
Elizabeth, and in the drawing-room a vitrine filled with
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_216" title="pg 216"> </a>
relics of the "Virgin Queen." It was curious to see her
gloves, shoes, hat. I think Lady Salisbury was somewhat
surprised at my interest in these last things, but
I told her she must make allowances for the American,
who was not accustomed to old family traditions and
souvenirs of that kind. When I think of our Revolution,
then it seems ages ago to me. We enjoyed our visit
extremely, they are all so nice and simple.</p>

<p>We got back to London this morning and of course
dined out somewhere. I was amused by one of the ladies
saying to me after dinner, "Did you really enjoy your
visit to Hatfield? Aren't they all <em>dreadfully</em> clever?" I
don't think I should have applied the same adverb, but
clever they certainly are. Lord Salisbury has such a
fine, thoughtful face.</p>

<p>We went to Ascot this morning, a beautiful day, and
the lawn like a flower garden with all the women in their
light dresses dotted about. We lunched with the Prince
and Princess of Wales. The Maharajah of Johore was
there, and had brought down his own cook, attired in
yellow satin with a large flat hat on his head. He made
a sort of curry for his master, which everybody tasted&mdash;except
me&mdash;I don't like culinary experiments, and I
think the yellow satin garments didn't inspire me with
confidence. I told Juteau when he came up for orders
just now how far below the mark he was as to costume.</p>

<p>I went this afternoon with Francis to Lord Aberdeen's,
where they had a hay-making party. They have a pretty
little cottage, or rather a small farm about an hour's
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_217" title="pg 217"> </a>
drive from London. There were plenty of people, and
all sorts of amusements for the children; Punch and
Judy, lawn-tennis, and two tea-tables on the lawn.
After tea they all rushed down a steep hill to a field
where there were quantities of little heaps of hay, and
harmless wooden pitchforks. They had a fine time rolling
and tumbling about in the hay and making hay-stacks.
Then a cow appeared on the scene, dressed
with flowers and ribbons, and the maids made syllabub
on the spot, which the children enjoyed immensely.</p>

<p>We dined at Lady Molesworth's with the Duc d'Aumale,
who is always charming, and makes everything
easy, as there are always bothering little questions of
official etiquette with non-reigning Princes. He is a
fine type of the soldier-prince. It seems hard that a man
of his intelligence and education shouldn't play a great
part in his own country.</p>

<p>We had the Court concert this evening. The Duc
d'Aumale was there, looking so well and so royal. He
is always charming to us, and we were very proud of our
French Prince. H. came with us and enjoyed herself
extremely. The entrance of the Court amused her very
much, the two tall Chamberlains with their wands walking
backwards. She says she never saw anything so
pretty as the curtsey the Princess of Wales made to the
assembled company as soon as she got into the room.
What always appeals in some sort of way to our <em>irreverent</em>
American minds is the singing of the "God Save the
Queen," all the company, including Prince and Princess,
rising and standing.</p>

<p>I will begin my letter here to-day, Dear Jan, from the
Stanhopes' place, where we came last evening to spend
Sunday. It was awfully hot yesterday. I almost died
on the way from London down, fortunately it was only
an hour. We are a party of 14&mdash;Lord and Lady John
Manners, Lord Derby and his step-daughter, Lady Margaret
Cecil, Mr. and Mrs. Edward Stanhope, Mr. and
Mrs. Jeune, Lord Boston, a nice young fellow, and a Mr.
Praed, a riding man, who has travelled everywhere. We
had tea on the terrace overlooking a lovely garden and
lake, and dined at 8. After dinner we sat on the terrace,
and it was charming, a beautiful full moon, and not a
breath of air. Friday we had the closing festivity of the
season at Marlborough House. A beautiful ball it
was, about 600 people, all the cr&egrave;me de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
and beautiful dresses and jewels. I wore my pink
and green Moscow dress (my Russian garments have
done me good service this year), and it was much
admired. All the Battenberg family were there in
great force, and I renewed acquaintance with the
Prince of Bulgaria, whom I used to know. They
had covered in a great part of the garden, and the room
was beautifully arranged with the Prince's Indian carpets
and arms. The supper room, also built out in the garden,
was so pretty&mdash;a collection of small round tables for
8 or 10 persons, with flowers and handsome silver.
Prince Albert Victor took me in, and I had a young
Battenberg next. Neither Phelps nor Harry White was
there, on account of Grant's death, which I thought
very nice of them. I danced once or twice after supper,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_219" title="pg 219"> </a>
and we came away at 2. I hear they kept it up until 5,
having begun at 11. There is a reception at Lady Salisbury's
on Tuesday, which will be really the end of all
things, and purely political, as all the swells go off to
Goodwood Monday.</p>

<p class="author">11.30.</p>

<p>We have just come upstairs after a very hot day. I
didn't go to church, as I knew I could not stand the heat,
and talked a little and read very happily in the big drawing-room
till luncheon. Lady Stanhope took me over
the house, which is not very large, but interesting. There
is a charming library full of books and manuscripts and
letters, some from Lord Chesterfield to his son, written
in French, and beginning "Mon cher ami, comment vont
les gr&acirc;ces et les mani&egrave;res." After luncheon, we sat
out under the lime trees, and after tea I made a little
tourn&eacute;e with Lord Stanhope and prowled about the park,
and went also to the church, where there are several
interesting monuments. This evening we have been
sitting again on the terrace, quite delicious. I in my
white dress, with nothing on my shoulders.</p>

<p>We got back yesterday at 2 o'clock and the weather
has changed to-day. It was very hot all day yesterday.
I spent the afternoon on my sofa until 6.30, when
we went for a ride and met the few last people who
are still here. Last night we discussed our summer
plans, and I shall go over to France on Saturday
with Francis, stay three or four days in Paris, and
then go down to St. L&eacute;ger. It is curious how London
is suddenly empty. There were not 5 carriages in the
park yesterday. This morning I have been careering
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_220" title="pg 220"> </a>
about the stable-yard trying a new habit. They are so
difficult to make in these days, so tight that the least
change of saddle makes them go every way but the right
one. I don't know if I wrote after the Harwoods
lunched with us. W. was much pleased with them and
found them a most attractive family. The girls are
charming, so pretty and simple. I must stop, as Holmes
(the English butler) is waiting for me to tell him all
sorts of final arrangements before we start.</p>

<p>The young King of Spain is dead. The Ambassador,
M. de Casa La Iglesia, was to have dined with us. He
sent a note at 5.30 saying that he must give up the
pleasure of dining with us for a "bien p&eacute;nible raison," but
without saying what it was&mdash;so one of the secretaries
went off "aux informations" and came back with the
news that the King was dead. Poor young fellow, his
reign was short.</p>

<p class="author">December 5th.</p>

<p>We had a service at the Spanish chapel in Manchester
Square for the King of Spain. All the Diplomats and
official world there. It was very long&mdash;all the ladies
were in black&mdash;Comtesse Karolyi (Austrian Ambassadress)
and Comtesse de Bylandt (wife of the Dutch Minister)
in cr&ecirc;pe, long veils. They told me I was not at
all correct, that a cr&ecirc;pe veil was "de rigueur" for
crowned heads. I thought I was all right in black
velvet, a tulle veil, and black gloves (in fact was rather
pleased with my get-up), but the ladies were very stern.</p>

<p>I wish you were here this morning, Dear, as the Embassy
is a curiosity&mdash;might just as well be in Kamtchatka
as far as the outside world is concerned&mdash;for
nothing exists beyond the walls of the house. When
they drew back my curtains this morning I couldn't really
think for a moment where I was. Adela&iuml;de had a lighted
candle in her hand (it was 8.30 o'clock in the morning)
and I thought my window panes had been painted a dirty
yellow in the night. However it was only a yellow London
fog; I could literally see nothing when I went to the
window. It has lightened now a little, but we have had
lamps for breakfast, and I am writing with my candles!
The big shops opposite are all lighted, and one sees little
glimmers of light through the fog. I can't see across
the street. The fog gets into everything&mdash;was quite
thick and perceptible in the hall when we went down to
breakfast. The coachman has been in and said he
couldn't take out his horses, not even with a link-boy
running alongside, so let us hope it will brighten up a
little in the course of the afternoon.</p>

<p class="author">December 16th.</p>

<p>The fog did lift about 4; but the day was trying and
the traces most evident the next day, as everything in
the house was filthy&mdash;all the silver candlesticks and little
silver ornaments that are on the tables; the white curtains&mdash;in
fact everything one touched. I should think
laundresses would make their fortune in London. My
maid came to my room about 3 o'clock, just as I was
going out, with her apron really black with smuts. I
said, "What in the world have you been doing, cleaning
the chimneys?" "Non, Madame, je n'ai fait que travailler
chez Madame et dans la lingerie; j'ai voulu montrer mon

<p>Yesterday I made an excursion to the city with Hilda
Deichmann and her husband to buy things for our Christmas
trees. It was most amusing ransacking in all the
big wholesale houses, and reminded me of my childish
days and similar expeditions to Maiden Lane. There
is so much always in England that recalls early days. I
think it is not only the language, but the education
and way of living are the same. We have read the same
books and sung the same hymns, and understand things
in the same way. Our shopping was most successful.
All the prettiest things come from the German shops.
The ginger-bread animals were wonderful,&mdash;some horses
and dogs with gilt tails and ears most effective. The
decorations were really very pretty&mdash;the stars and angels
quite charming. When we had finished our shopping
Deichmann took us to Pym's, a celebrated oyster cellar,
to lunch. A funny little place well known to all City
people. We had a capital lunch&mdash;all oysters.</p>

<p>This afternoon we have been playing, 8 hands, two
pianos, which was interesting. Two of our colleagues,
Princess Ghika, Roumanian Legation, and Countess de
Bylandt, Dutch, are excellent musicians. They lead, and
Hilda and I follow as well as we can. I am the least
good, but I manage to get along, and of course whenever
I know the music my ear helps me. We have two
fine &Eacute;rard grand pianos in the drawing-room, which is
large, and fairly light for London. I was much tempted
by a beautiful Steinway piano, but thought it right at the
French Embassy to have &Eacute;rards, which are of course fine
instruments. I fancy Steinway is more brilliant, but I
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_223" title="pg 223"> </a>
think we make noise enough, particularly when we are
playing Wagner&mdash;the <em>Kaiser March</em> for instance.</p>

<p class="author">December 23d.</p>

<p>It was not very cold this morning, so I tried the
new horse, and he went very well. I have had a thick
hunting habit made, and was quite comfortable, except
the hands, which were cold at starting. I fussed all day
over the Christmas tree which we are to have on the
26th, and this evening we had a small farewell dinner for
Nigra, the Italian Ambassador, who is going away to
Vienna. I am very sorry, as he is a good colleague and an
easy and charming talker. He sat a long time with me
the other day talking over his Paris experiences and the
brilliant days of the Empire&mdash;Tuileries, Compi&egrave;gne, etc.
It was most interesting and new to me, as I only know
Paris since the war (1870) and have never seen either
Emperor or Empress. I suppose I never shall see her,
as she never comes to London, and lives a very secluded
life at Farnborough with a small household, and some
Paris friends who come sometimes, not very often, to
see her. What a tragic "fin de vie" hers is, having had
everything and lost everything. We had also the Russian
and Spanish Ambassadors&mdash;Staal charming, clever,
easy, simple&mdash;"simpatico," the only word I know in any
language which expresses exactly that combination of
qualities. Casa La Iglesia, the Spaniard, is a tall, handsome,
attractive-looking man. He made havoc in the
various posts he has occupied, and when we want to
tease him we ask him about his departure from Berlin,
and all the "femmes affol&eacute;es" who were at the station
to see the last of him. Henrietta and Anne have arrived
for Christmas, laden of course with presents and souvenirs
for everybody, and Francis is quite happy with
his aunts.</p>

<p>The sisters and I have been shopping all day getting
the last things for the tree, which is to be on the 26th.
The streets are most animated, full of people, all carrying
parcels, and all with smiling faces. The big toy-shops
and confectioners crowded. "Buzzard," the great shop
in Oxford Street, most amusing; hundreds of Christmas
cakes of all sizes. There are plum cakes frosted with
sugar icing, the date generally in red letters and a sprig
of ivy or evergreen stuck in at the top. We had ordered
a large one, and they were much pleased to do it for the
French Embassy, and wanted to make the letters in "tri-color,"
red, white, and blue. We wound up at the
Army and Navy Stores, and really had some difficulty
in getting in. They had quantities of Christmas trees
already decorated, which were being sold as fast as they
were brought in.</p>

<p>There were splendid turkeys, enormous; and curiously
enough they told us many of them came from France,
from a well-known turkey farm in the Loiret. I must
ask the S&eacute;gurs, who live in that part of the country, if
they know the place. There were quantities of plum-puddings
of all sizes and prices, and it must be a very
poor household that doesn't have its plum-pudding to-morrow.
We were glad to get back to tea and hot buttered
toast&mdash;a thoroughly English institution. I would
like some of my French servants to learn how to make it,
but I don't suppose they will. In fact I don't know
exactly who makes it here&mdash;I am quite sure neither
Juteau nor his "gar&ccedil;on de cuisine" would condescend to
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_225" title="pg 225"> </a>
do anything so simple. I suppose it isn't the "odd man"
who seems to do all the things that no one else will, but
I sha'n't inquire as long as it appears.</p>

<p>We had a quiet evening&mdash;talked a little politics while
W. was smoking. Henrietta always sees a great many
people of all kinds, and tells him various little things
that don't come to him in his official despatches. The
house is comfortable enough, though there is no calorif&egrave;re,
and it is a corner house. There are enormous
coal fires everywhere, except in my bedroom and dressing-room,
where I always burn wood&mdash;and such wood&mdash;little
square pieces like children's blocks.</p>

<p class="author">Christmas Day.</p>

<p>It was dark and foggy this morning, we could hardly
see the trees opposite, and the lamps are lighted in the
house and the streets. Francis was enchanted with his
presents. I think the billiard-table from Paris and the
big boat ("aussi grand que Monsieur Toutain"&mdash;one of
our Secretaries) were what pleased him most. There is a
sort of sailing match every Sunday morning on the Serpentine.
Some really beautiful boats (models) full-rigged,
and it is a pretty sight to see them all start a
miniature yacht race across the river. Francis always
goes with Clarisse, and Yves, his own little Breton footman,
carries his boat, which is much bigger than he is,
also Boniface, a wise little fox-terrier who knows all
about it, and gallops around the top of the lake to meet
his master's boat on the other side. They have also one
of the Park keepers and a gigantic policeman, who is always
on duty at Albert Gate, to look after them. Not a
useless precaution, as the boat often gets entangled in
the reeds, and <em>has</em> been known to go to the bottom of
the lake, and Boniface always gets lost and is brought
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_226" title="pg 226"> </a>
back by a policeman or a soldier, or a friend&mdash;Hilda
Deichmann brought him back one day.</p>

<p>We had a cheerful Christmas dinner&mdash;all our personnel&mdash;M.
Blanchard de Forges, Consul General, and Villiers,
the correspondent of the "D&eacute;bats" in London. We
did a little music after dinner. I tried for some Christmas
carols "We Three Kings of Orient Are" (do you
remember that at Oyster Bay? how long ago it seems),
but the English-speaking element was not strong
enough. We danced a little, winding up with a sort of
Scotch reel&mdash;Henrietta, Waru (our Military Attach&eacute;),
and Petiteville being the chief performers.</p>

<p class="author">December 26th.</p>

<p>We are all rather exhausted after the Christmas tree;
however, the children were quite pleased, and the tree
really very pretty. A gigantic pine, reaching to the top
of the ceiling in the ballroom, a star on the top and very
well lighted. We had 34 children of all ages and nationalities,
from Nadine Karolyi, aged 18, daughter of
Count Karolyi, Austrian Ambassador and Doyen of the
Corps Diplomatique, to Florence Williams' baby girl
of 16 months. The little ones were sweet, speechless at
first, with round eyes fixed on the tree, and then little
fat arms stretched out for something. The children's
tea-table looked pretty, arranged with coloured candles
and holly, and an enormous Christmas cake in the middle
with a wreath of holly around it. Nadine Karolyi cut
the first slice of cake, as daughter of the Doyen she sat on
Francis's right hand, and Thekla Staal, daughter of the
Russian Ambassador, on his left. W. was much amused
at the correct placing of the young ladies. We start to-morrow
for Knowsley and Luton Hoo, and the packing
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_227" title="pg 227"> </a>
is quite an affair. I take 10 dresses, besides jackets, hats,
etc. I must have short costumes to follow the battues
for fine and bad weather&mdash;a swell day dress, as we are to
lunch at Croxteth, Lord Sefton's place near Knowsley;
and two ball dresses, as there is to be a county ball for
all the neighbourhood at Luton, New Year's night, and
a small dance with a cotillon (which is unusual in England)
the next night. Adela&iuml;de is rather fatigued, as besides
my trunk she has to finish off her toilettes, and she
has just come in to ask me if she shall take the regulation
black silk, or a blue silk, which is more dressy; as they
tell her the <em>ladies</em> in the housekeeper's room are very
dressy at Luton. I said the blue silk by all means&mdash;she
must be up to the mark. The fog has kept up pretty
well all day. I hope it will clear to-morrow, we are
going straight into the coal country. Knowsley is near
Liverpool, and I fancy it is always dark there.</p>

<p>I was telling Nigra the other day about our first Roman
Christmas and what an impression it made upon us.
Such a splendid winter, always a bright blue sky, and
roses straggling over all the old grey walls. The
Pifferari singing to the Madonnas at all the street corners,
the midnight Mass and mysterious Pastorale in St.
Peter's at early dawn with the tapers trembling on the
high altar so far away; and the grand Christmas ceremony
at St. Peter's, with all the magnificent pomp of the
Catholic Church in Rome. We talked on for some
time about "Roma com' era," which of course he doesn't
regret, and I told him of our last night in Rome, when we
all went "en bande" to drink at the Fountain of Trevi
(which is supposed to act as a charm and to bring people
back to Rome). I remember quite well how tearful I
was when we left. I didn't think then that life was worth
living out of the shadow of St. Peter's, and think so a
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_228" title="pg 228"> </a>
little still even now, though my lines have lain in very
different places.</p>

<p>We leave Francis in the sisters' charge, with the joys

December 29, 1885.</p>

<p>We arrived here late yesterday afternoon. It is a long,
uninteresting journey (almost to Liverpool), was cold
and foggy all the way down, and we found snow when
we arrived in the Park&mdash;also a perfect gale of wind, the
enormous bare, black winter trees swaying like poplars.
The large house, with all the fa&ccedil;ade brightly lighted,
gave us at once a cheerful welcome. Lady Derby was
waiting for us in the long, low drawing-room with tea,
and we went up almost immediately to dress for dinner.
We had sent the servants by an earlier train, which was
convenient, as they had time to unpack and have everything
ready for us. We have a charming apartment&mdash;a
very good-sized salon, with bedrooms large and comfortable
on each side. The salon furnished in a bright chintz,
and good pictures, mostly family portraits, on the walls.
There were blazing fires everywhere&mdash;these enormous
rocks of Liverpool coal one sees here. I instantly proceeded
to demolish mine in my bedroom. Adela&iuml;de had
already tried to make the housemaid understand that her
lady didn't like warm rooms, but the other one pointed
to the snow under the windows, and heaped on her pieces
of coal.</p>

<p>Dinner was at 8 <em>punctually</em> (which was a contrast to
Hatfield, where we had been staying the other day.
There dinner was easily half past eight, and after we had
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_229" title="pg 229"> </a>
been at table some little time various friends and members
of the family appeared, and slid quietly into their
places at the end of the very long table). There is a
large family party here and some other guests, including
the two historians, Froude and Lecky, both most interesting.</p>

<p class="center small">Knowsley Hall<br >

<p>We dined in a fine hall with family portraits of all the
Derbys, from the first one at Bosworth down to the present
Earl, who is the 16th Earl of Derby. There was
beautiful plate on the table&mdash;fine racing cups&mdash;as the
Stanleys were always quite as much racing men as statesmen.
These are such curious things in England, the
love of sport is so strong. Fancy any of our statesmen,
Thiers, Guizot, Dufaure, etc., with racing stables. Lord
Derby is very easy and rather inclined to chaff Americans
a little, but I didn't mind. The evening was short after
we adjourned to the drawing-room. Lady Derby is
rather delicate, and is suffering just now from a bad eye.
I sat some time in my comfortable room upstairs, but was
glad to get to bed early after the cold journey. W.
went off to the fumoir, and had a most interesting talk
over Ireland and Irish questions with Mr. Lecky. This
morning was awful; snow, sleet, and a cold rain&mdash;however,
the sportsmen were not to be deterred by any such
mild obstacle, and started at 9.30 in a big break with four
horses. I watched the departure from my window, and
was very glad I was not going to make any such expedition.
I had my breakfast upstairs, and had an amusing
explanation with the housemaid who appeared at 9.30
with an enormous tray and breakfast enough for a family&mdash;tea,
beefsteaks, cold partridges, eggs, rolls, toast, potatoes,
buns and fruit&mdash;you never saw such a meal. She
couldn't believe that I only wanted tea and toast and an
egg (which was an extra, but as I knew we should only
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_230" title="pg 230"> </a>
lunch at two, and I am accustomed to have my d&eacute;jeuner
&agrave; la fourchette at 12, I was sure I should be hungry if I
didn't take something), and asked me most respectfully
if I was not well, and would like something else&mdash;"a little
soup perhaps."</p>

<p>I went downstairs about 12 and found the ladies in the
drawing-room all complaining of the cold. Lady Derby
took me over the house&mdash;it has not the beautiful proportions
of Hatfield&mdash;is long, low, and rambling, but most
comfortable. The library is a fine room with deep window
recesses, and most comfortable with a bright fire
burning. The librarian was there and showed us some
of his treasures, among them an old copy of the "Roman
de la Rose," and various old manuscripts. We went on
to the dining-room, and Lady Derby explained the family
portraits to me. The long, unbroken line of Earls of
Derby is most interesting, and the change in the portraits
for the two or three generations where the French blood
shows itself, most curious. The wife of the Earl of
Derby who died on the scaffold, giving his life for his
King, was the famous Charlotte de la Tr&eacute;mouille, who
defended her castle&mdash;Lathom House&mdash;so gallantly
against Fairfax and his Roundheads. Do you remember
one of our school-room books in America, "Heroines of
History," where there was a description of the siege of
Lathom House, and a picture of the Countess of Derby
standing on the ramparts in a riding habit and hat and
feathers and apparently loading a cannon herself and
showing a gunner how to point it?</p>

<p>The portraits are most interesting; first the regular
Saxon type, then the French streak, pale oval faces, and
dark eyes and hair (not unlike the Stuarts, who have
always a foreign look); then the true British, more and
more accentuated down to the present Earl. They have
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_231" title="pg 231"> </a>
also in one of the halls the block on which the Lord
Derby knelt who was beheaded in 1631.</p>

<p>The sportsmen arrived about tea-time, apparently
neither cold nor tired, and having had a fine shoot.</p>

<p class="author">New Year's Day, 1886.</p>

<p>We are leaving this afternoon for Luton, Mme. de
Falbe's place, where there is a ball and cotillon to-night.
We were to go and join the shooters yesterday, but it
was rainy and cold, and the ladies didn't care to go out.
The talk at luncheon was pleasant; Froude is brilliant and
easy. His American experiences and stories were amusing,
but I told him he mustn't take the very eccentric
ladies and gentlemen whom he had encountered as specimens
of Americans. I didn't know any such people, that
really most of us were quite quiet and ordinary, and like
everybody else. Lord Derby rather urged him on, and
was amused at our perfectly amicable discussion. We
drove over to Croxteth, Lord Sefton's place, after lunch.
The park is fine and they have capital shooting. Our
evening was quiet, and we broke up early, as they always
have a midnight service in the chapel on New Year's eve
for the family and servants and any of the guests who
like to attend. We left the drawing-room at 10.30, so
that the servants might put out the lights, finish their
work, etc., and also to have time to get out of our low
dresses and jewels. A little before 12 Lady Margaret
Cecil (Lady Derby's daughter by her first husband, Lord
Salisbury) came for us and we went to the chapel. I
had put on a dark cloth dress and jacket, nothing on my
head. The chapel was full, all the servants (including
my French maid) and household. Lady Margaret, looking
like a saint in her plain black dress, and beautiful earnest
expression, sat at the little organ, and everybody,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_232" title="pg 232"> </a>
gardeners, keepers, coachmen, cooks, housemaids, joined
in the singing. It was very solemn and impressive. At
the end of the service we all went out first, and then Lady
Margaret and her brother Lord Lionel stood at the head
of the stairs and shook hands with all the guests, and all
the servants, wishing all a "Happy New Year." It was
a nice beginning of the New Year. Lord Derby hopes
our next one will be also in England and at Knowsley,
but everything is so uncertain, and of such short duration
in our country (especially Cabinets) that we can
hardly look forward a year.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Luton</span>,<br >
January 3, 1886.</p>

<p>Our journey yesterday from Knowsley was not very
long, and some of the country all about Matlock, in
Derbyshire, quite wild and lovely. Our host here is M.
de Falbe, Danish Minister, who married Mrs. Leigh,
owner of this charming place. We found the house
party, mostly young, assembled in the morning-room
with tea, the ladies all, as usual, in very dressy tea-gowns.
I can't quite get used to that fashion, though
I see it is very practical in the country at this season.
Everyone goes out (in all weathers generally) from
luncheon till tea-time, and of course one must get out of
short skirts and muddy boots before coming down to the
drawing-room. We went up early to dress, as Mme. de
Falbe wanted to dine precisely at 8, on account of the
ball afterwards. The house is large, with endless corners
and corridors, fine drawing-rooms, library, and a large
chapel with a fine organ. The dinner was handsome and
very well arranged, five round tables, and quantities of
silver, flowers, servants, etc. About 10.30 the company
began to arrive, many county neighbours, Salisburys,
Lyttons, Caledons, etc., bringing their house parties with
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_233" title="pg 233"> </a>
them. We had a very pretty cotillon. At the end the
children's pony came in carrying two big baskets filled
with presents. The poor little thing was very gentle,
but was evidently afraid of slipping on the parquet floor.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, 3d.</p>

<p>To-day has been charming; first the service in the
house chapel, very good organ music&mdash;Mme. de Falbe is
musical and arranges everything. After breakfast they
organized a paper hunt for the "jeunesse" in the park,
and the older people walked about. The rendezvous
was the dairy&mdash;a model one, quite delightful with tiles,
and creepers running along the walls and peeping everywhere
in at the windows. One by one the young
people assembled, flushed and exhausted with running,
and all clamouring for tea. Comte Jacques de Pourtal&egrave;s
(one of our Secretaries), a young officer of the
Blues, and Forbes, Mme. de Falbe's son-in-law, were
the hares and got in some time before the hounds.
After tea Falbe took me over to the stables, where there
were plenty of horses, and also to the "vacherie," which
was perfect. They have 40 small Alderney cows, all the
same breed and colour, pretty little beasts, and so wonderfully
clean, kept like pet dogs.</p>

<p>The dinner and evening was most lively, choruses, banjos
(which is a favourite instrument in English houses),
and every kind of game, including musical chairs&mdash;M. de
Falbe at the piano. I think everyone played except the
Falbes and ourselves. W. and Falbe retired afterwards
to the smoking-room, and were deep in foreign politics.
Falbe is a perfect type of the diplomatist, tall, good-looking,
and a charming, courteous manner. We ladies went
off about 11, and an hour later we heard the most unearthly
noises in the house. All the men parading the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_234" title="pg 234"> </a>
corridors with banjos, bells, gongs, etc., and singing (if
singing it can be called) at the top of their voices. They
stopped at every door to serenade. The party breaks
up to-morrow, and we all go back to London.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
Sunday, January 17, 1886.</p>

<p>We had a musical dinner last night for Miss Griswold
and Albanesi, and they sang and played all the evening.
Albanesi has a charming, delicate touch, and plays with
all the Italian brio. He told me&mdash;what surprised me&mdash;that
he was always frightfully nervous when playing in
public, and much preoccupied with the "composition de
la salle"&mdash;if he saw one or two unsympathetic faces he
had at once a disagreeable sensation! Gertrude Griswold
has always the same lovely voice with a beautiful
clear ring in it, and sings most artistically.</p>

<p>This morning we have been to church at St. Paul's.
It is a fine service, a splendid organ, and very good well-trained
choir&mdash;but not at all solemn. I felt as if I was
in one of the great Catholic cathedrals in Italy. People
were coming and going all the time, and walking about
the church. It is so enormous that it is quite a walk from
the big doors to the small (comparatively) enclosed space
where the congregation assembles.</p>

<p>I have been at home all the afternoon receiving&mdash;men
only, which is a regular London custom. Adams came in
at tea-time. He and W. always like to have a good talk
over old times. They were at school and college together,
and Adams, when he was Charg&eacute; d'Affaires at
the British Embassy, used to have all sorts of questions
to treat with W., who was then Ministre des Affaires
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_235" title="pg 235"> </a>
&Eacute;trangeres in Paris. They always began their conversations
in French, and then fell into English, which of
course they had always spoken together.</p>

<p>To-night we have a small dinner for Rustem Pacha,
and I have asked one or two people in the evening. I
should like to be at home always on Sunday night, as we
did in the Champs &Eacute;lys&eacute;es, but they tell me no English
will come. Many of them don't go out on Sunday night,
and don't take their horses out, and give servants a rest.
I asked Lady A., who is very mondaine, if she would
come to dinner to meet a few colleagues, and she said&mdash;"Dear
Mme. Waddington, let me come another night;
I never take out my carriage and servants on Sunday."</p>

<p>Jean Gordon Gumming is very much exercised over
what she calls my French ways, and constantly tells me
people don't do such and such things in England; but I
always tell her the French Embassy is <em>not</em> England; however,
she is rather worried over me, and finds me un-English
(which is not surprising) and unconventional,
which is also not surprising, considering my nationality.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author">January 21, 1886.</p>

<p>We have had a great function to-day, the Queen
opened Parliament. We all went in gala, Countess D'A.
and P. with us, the men in uniform, I in red satin, low,
with diamonds and feathers. The road was lined with
policemen and mounted soldiers in lieu of infantry, as
there would have been with us. As we passed through
the Horse-Guards the trumpeters saluted. We went at
once into the great hall of the Lords', which was a fine
sight. All the peers were there in their scarlet robes
trimmed with white fur, and the women in low dresses,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_236" title="pg 236"> </a>
diamonds, and feathers (feathers play a great part in all
English toilettes). The Judges also were in full dress,
with wigs and gowns. About 1.30 the Princes began to
arrive, Prince of Wales, Dukes of Edinburgh, Connaught,
and Cambridge all also in scarlet robes with
bands of ermine and gold, and the collar of the Garter.
We sat close to the Throne (Countess Karolyi didn't
come, so I was Doyenne), then Madame de Staal and the
Duchesses Bedford, Hamilton, Sutherland, and others.
The Prince of Wales stood next to me some time, presenting
the Duke of Connaught, whom I had not seen,
and talked pleasantly enough, explaining various things
to me; also said he was rather shy at taking his seat on
the raised platform until the last moment. He had an
arm-chair on the right of the Throne. I asked him for
whom the other arm-chair was and he said it was his
father's, had never been used since his death, and showed
me the Saxon arms on it. The three brothers, Wales,
Edinburgh, and Connaught, remained standing together.
The other Princes, Christian, Duke of Teck, and Henry
of Battenberg, were opposite to us; Battenberg, who
has a slight, stylish figure, looking handsome in British
Volunteer Uniform (dark green) with the collar of the
Garter. Teck looks badly, older and thinner. He must
have been a very handsome man (which, by the way, he
tells one frequently). When Prince Alexander of Battenberg
was at one of the Court balls everyone was talking
about him and saying what a magnificent man he was.
Teck, who was dancing a quadrille with me, was much
put out, and said to me, "Do you really find Battenberg
so very handsome? It is a pity you didn't know me
when I was his age; I was much handsomer," and appealed
to Count D., Austrian Ambassador, an old friend
and "compagnon d'armes," to support his statement,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_237" title="pg 237"> </a>
which I must say he did most warmly, and one can quite
see it.</p>

<p>All the Ambassadors and men of the Corps Diplomatique
faced us&mdash;the English women were upstairs.
About 2.30 (we had been there since 1.30) we heard a
trumpet call, and all the company stood up. We women
dropped our cloaks, and the Prince took his place standing
on the dais. Presently appeared the Garter King-at-Arms
and various officers of the household. The Duke
of Portland stood on the right of the Throne holding a
Royal crown on a cushion. Lord Salisbury (Premier)
carried a large sword with a double handle, and then
came the Queen followed by Princess Beatrice and
Princes Eddie and George of Wales. The Queen was
dressed in black satin with a long train, lined and trimmed
with ermine, quantities of diamonds on her neck and corsage,
the blue ribbon of the Garter, and a regular closed
crown of diamonds, and white veil. As she came in the
Prince of Wales advanced, touched the ground with one
knee, kissed her hand, and led her to the Throne. He
did his part most easily and gracefully, and didn't look at
all shy. The Queen's train was carried by Sir Henry
Ponsonby and two pages in red and gold. Princess
Beatrice and the Duchess of Buccleuch (Mistress of the
Robes) stood behind the Queen on her right, Princes
Eddie and George on her left, Lord Salisbury, Halsbury,
Lathom, and some others were also on the dais. As
soon as the Queen was settled on her Throne she bowed
to us all right and left. We made deep curtseys, and
then she made a sign that we were to sit down. There
was a few moments' silence while they went to summon
the Commons. Then one heard a noise of scrambling
and racing in the corridors&mdash;and they appeared; the
Speaker, looking very well in his wig and gown, came
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_238" title="pg 238"> </a>
first, fairly shot into the hall like a bomb by the impatient
crowd behind him. Then the Lord Chancellor, asking
the Queen's permission, read her speech in a clear,
distinct voice, so that one heard every word. It was very
short, and as soon as it was over the Queen went away
with the same ceremony as when she came. When she
got to the foot of the dais she made a very pretty half
curtsey. The Princes left directly afterwards&mdash;we too.
The crowd in the street was tremendous, everyone always
is anxious to see the Queen, and much excited over the
cream-coloured Hanoverian horses which she uses when
she goes anywhere in semi-state. As they only go out
very seldom it is rather a responsibility for the Master
of the Horse to see that they are perfectly quiet.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Windsor</span>, March 8, 1886.</p>

<p>We are at Windsor for the second time to dine and
sleep, and we are "Doyens" now, so have a sweller apartment
in one of the towers&mdash;the walls so thick that they
make splendid deep window recesses (and a piano). We
had asked an audience of Princess Beatrice, who received
us before dinner about 7. I wore my brown velvet in
which I had come down, and we found her in a small
salon with a piano and pretty pictures and bibelots about.
She was in an ordinary red costume, and was rather cold
and shy at first, but thawed when Battenberg appeared.
He has a delightful easy way, that sort of charm that
so many Poles have. The party was a small one&mdash;no
other diplomats but Mr. and Mrs. Phelps, both charming,
and some English. The ceremony was quite the same
as before. The Queen came about nine and went alone
into the dining-room, and had her two sons-in-law,
Christian and Battenberg, on each side. W. took in
Princess Beatrice, and Mr. Phelps me, so I was quite
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_239" title="pg 239"> </a>
happy. The Queen spoke little, in German, principally,
to her neighbours, the English scarcely at all, and almost
in whispers. I don't know what would happen to me if
I dined often at court, I couldn't sit at table for an hour
without talking to someone. Mr. P. says American
women are not made for courts and convenances. They
lose all their charm if they are not natural, and I think
he is right. The cercle lasted about an hour. The Queen
and I talked music. She regrets M&uuml;nster, who is going
to Paris.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, March 9.</p>

<p>We were asked this morning if we would like to drive
to the Mausoleum before we went back to town, which
we accepted of course. W. and I went in an open
carriage, a pair of horses and postillion, and Lord Thurlow,
Lord in Waiting, with us. In the next came Mr.
and Mrs. Phelps with Mrs. F., Lady in Waiting. We
drove down the "long walk" to the Mausoleum, which is
not very far from the Castle. It is a handsome building
with a fine marble floor like some of the old Italian
chapels. The tomb of the Prince Consort is very fine,
with a recumbent marble statue and a place beside it
for the Queen when her turn comes. There is a pretty
monument "In Memoriam" to Princess Alice (of Hesse)
with her child in her arms, and a tablet to the memory
of John Brown as "a grateful tribute from Queen Victoria
to the faithful servant and friend of 34 years." We
then drove to Frogmore and saw the farm, basse-cour,
dairy, etc., and took the 12.30 train back to London.
This evening we have had a handsome dinner and reception
at the Russian Embassy; the whole house open, band
playing, and all London there. The Duchess of Edinburgh
dined. Corti made his first appearance in the
"grand monde" as Ambassador. He is much pleased to
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_240" title="pg 240"> </a>
be in London. I don't know if he and W. will be very
cordial colleagues, as Corti decidedly resented W.'s attitude
in the Berlin Congress.</p>


<h3><em>To J. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Clieveden, Maidenhead</span>,<br >
Sunday, March 29, 1886.</p>

<p>I will begin my letter this evening, Dear Jan, in this
most lovely place of the Duke of Westminster's which
Karolyi, the Austrian Ambassador, always hires, until
after Easter, as his wife hates to spend the winter in town.
We came down yesterday afternoon with one of their
secretaries, a nice young fellow. We found the Karolyis
alone in a charming library filled with books in all
languages, and with the most enchanting view of the
Thames&mdash;quite like the view from Richmond Terrace,
if you remember it. They gave us tea&mdash;and about 7 we
went up to our rooms. Mine is the one the Duchess always
has, and W. has the dressing-room next, a large
room, all hung with rose-coloured silk, faded into yellow
now, an enormous bed with yellow silk curtains and
counterpane, a bath-room with marble bath opening out
of a little passage, quite complete, and always the same
divine view. The rooms are filled with pictures, souvenirs
of all the Sutherlands (whose place it was originally),
Westminsters, and all the English Royal family
of all ages. At 8 a gong sounded and we went down
to the library (where they live entirely), and found them
there with the addition of Count Victor Karolyi, a
cousin. The dinner was good, 4 servants, their chasseurs,
in Hungarian uniform, 2 in black and one in
plain livery. After dinner the 2 Karolyi men sat
down to cards, W. and the young man talked, also
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_241" title="pg 241"> </a>
Mme. K. and I&mdash;and all the men smoked. It was
easy enough, as everyone talked a great deal. We
broke up at 11. This morning we had breakfast at 10,
and afterwards Mme. K. showed me the house, which is
very handsome, one large, beautiful drawing-room opening
on the terrace and river view. They live only in the
library, as the rest is so enormous to light and heat. At
12 M. and Mme. de Staal, the Russian Ambassador and
his wife, arrived, and we went for a stroll in the grounds.
Went out again after lunch for a long walk down by the
river in short skirts and thick boots, as it was very damp&mdash;almost
always is on the banks, generally low, of the
Thames. It looked very pretty and gay, quite a number
of boats and some people we all knew, staying in one of
the houses near, got out of their boats and walked along
with us. We came in for tea at 5.30, and after that
adjourned to our respective rooms till dinner. The
evening was pleasant, as we were more numerous and
Staal talks a great deal. Now I am going to bed, as it
is 11 o'clock, and we breakfast at a quarter to ten to-morrow,
and get back to London at 11.30.</p>

<p>We got back this morning at 1 for lunch, and have
been in a wild state ever since with the bad news from
Tonkin and the defeat of our troops. The Ministry is
out, and Heaven knows what will happen. W. is as blue
as indigo over the news, as he had been very cocky over
Tonkin, as compared with the English blunders in the
Soudan. Already there are despatches in the clubs here,
saying W. has been asked to take the Foreign Office.
Of course he hasn't been asked, and I hope he won't
be, for I should hate to begin that official life in Paris
again, and I am very happy here now&mdash;however, one
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_242" title="pg 242"> </a>
never knows in political life. Do you know anything
about Phelps? W. is very anxious to have your
opinion. He says you ought to know about a Vermont
man. He will have a difficult "succession." Mr. Lowell
is much liked and admired.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,

<p>We have had a pleasant morning luncheon at Roll's
Court with Lord Esher, who showed us a quantity of
most interesting old manuscripts. A letter from "Bloody
Mary" to Cardinal Pole announcing her "grossesse" (the
arrival of a Prince), also the confession and signature of
Guy Fawkes after torture, such a wavering, faint signature,
"Guido." It is extraordinary how all the papers
and handwriting have lasted. All these old-world things
are so interesting to me, I seem to realize history so much
more. I hope to get over to Paris for a little this month.
We had a nice party (music) at Louisa Lady Ashburton's
this evening, and an interesting collection of people,
fashionable, literary, and <em>Salvation Army</em>. The house is
crowded with statues, pictures, and artistic treasures of
all kinds.</p>

<p>We seem to have a gleam of sunshine this afternoon,
Dear Jan, after weeks of bleak east winds and grey skies,
and we are going to take advantage of it to drive out to
White Lodge, Richmond Park, and see the Tecks. We
are revelling in Whitsuntide recess, and no dinners or banquets
until Friday, the second Court Concert. Last night
I went to the Op&eacute;ra with the Staals. It was "Faust,"
very well given, with Albani, Scalchi, and Gayare. The
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_243" title="pg 243"> </a>
house was fairly brilliant, but not full&mdash;the Prince and
Princess of Wales, Rothschilds, and a certain number of
people, who came to hear Albani (she is such a favourite
here). I should think it would be a losing operation.
Tell Janet Mlle. de Staal looks so nice, is so much
more animated, really very pretty, so high bred and always
well dressed. Lady Salisbury's reception at the
F. O. on Tuesday for the Queen's Birthday was very
brilliant; there were quantities of Princes; a Danish
Prince, brother of the Princess of Wales; a young
Russian Grand Duke, a son of the late Prince Frederick
Charles, brother of the Duchess of Connaught, and any
quantity of Maharajahs, covered with gold and silver
embroidery and diamonds and emeralds as big as eggs.
They always make a great fuss over the Indian Princes
at Court&mdash;treat them like Royalty, and give them very
good places. The Corps Diplomatique always protests.
The lion of the evening was Herbert Bismarck. From
the Prince of Wales down everyone, men and women,
was overwhelming him with attentions. I didn't think
the Danish Prince looked much pleased. He remarked
that "Bismarck had a most disagreeable voice." Lizzie
P. was wandering about looking very handsome. I
didn't see Buffalo Bill, which rather surprised me. I
suppose he is genuine, isn't he? He professed to remember
Captain King perfectly when I said I had a brother
who had been some time on the plains with his regiment.
Certainly the "Wild West Show" is most original and
entertaining. The Indians look savage enough to satisfy
anyone, and Buffalo Bill and the King of the Cowboys
are splendid specimens of frontiersmen.</p>

<p class="author">Monday.</p>

<p>I will finish this morning; it is still dark and rainy. We
went out yesterday to White Lodge and had a pleasant
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_244" title="pg 244"> </a>
visit. It was much too cold to sit out, so we had tea in
the gallery and enjoyed it very much. Princess Mary is
always so easy. The young Princess May looked very
nice in a light tweed with a white waistcoat. She asked
after Janet, and wanted to know if she was to be here this
season. I asked Princess Mary what she was going to
wear at the Jubilee Te Deum at Westminster. She said
she had no idea, but she had been told long dress, smart
bonnet, decorations and diamonds. It seems the Queen
is going to wear a white bonnet covered with diamonds.
I have asked no questions and mean to wear a short dress&mdash;no
one will see, as we do not join any cort&eacute;ge. We
arrive quite simply and go straight to our places. I
shall wear white lace with mousse velvet, and a
mousse bonnet with pink roses. Tell Janet, I am convinced
I shall never wear my moir&eacute; apricot dress from
Roulf, that I couldn't wear last year at any of the Court
f&ecirc;tes. I am sure the German Prince will die. They say
he may at any moment, as the excrescence in his throat
may increase, and then he would suffocate. Wouldn't it
be strange if that old Emperor outlived the son. Neither
sled nor fans have yet arrived. I suppose they will appear
soon. We have one or two things we mean to send
out, as soon as we have an opportunity&mdash;gloves, etc. I
should think some of the 75,000 Americans who are
coming over would go back in the course of the summer.
Princess Mary told me yesterday that a pretty
American girl&mdash;an heiress&mdash;she couldn't remember the
name&mdash;did I know?&mdash;is probably going to marry a
Count Btetju, aide-de-camp to the Prince of Denmark.
It seems he saw her here and fell in love with her at once.
I must stop now. Have any quantity of notes to write.</p>

<p>London is getting ready for the Jubilee and the streets
are crowded. Various Royalties have arrived, and one
meets Royal carriages, escorts, and strong squads of
police at every turn. It is warm and lovely to-day&mdash;so
was yesterday. W., Francis and I drove out to Sheen,
where W. plays tennis in Lord F.'s private court. I wandered
about under the trees, and Francis sailed his boat
in the pond and was quite happy. It is such a rest to
get a few hours in the country when one is going out all
the time as we are here&mdash;and above all not to have to
talk. We had a remarkable entertainment last night,
given by the Hawaiian Secretary (who is a German-American)
for his Queen, of the Sandwich Islands. We
arrived in due time, I rather protesting.</p>

<p>There was a large reception after dinner and the mistress
of the house asked us if we wouldn't stand by the
Queen and make a sort of cercle, and a funny contrast
we made&mdash;Mrs. P. beautifully dressed in white satin and
lace, Lady R. with splendid jewels, I wore my pink
brocade and old Venetian lace. It really was too absurd.
I talked a little to the Princess, who is intelligent
enough. The Queen is a great stickler for etiquette,
and insisted upon the same honours as any other Royalties,
an escort of <em>Life Guards</em>;&mdash;wouldn't accept any
less distinguished escort.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
June 18, 1887.</p>

<p>We have had rather an amusing afternoon. I think
I wrote you that we wanted to leave Westminster Abbey
the minute the ceremony was over, get through the line
of troops, and back to a friend's house in Piccadilly to see
the cort&eacute;ge&mdash;we being Mrs. Phelps and I. Our respective
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_246" title="pg 246"> </a>
husbands were most discouraging (as men always
are), but we dined last night with Knowles to meet the
Duke of Cambridge, and I told His Royal Highness what
we wanted to do, and asked him if he could help us.
After some little discussion he said he would advise us to
go directly to Sir Charles Warren (Chief of Police) and
see what he could arrange for us. Again our husbands
remonstrated, "Warren was overrun with applications of
all kinds, worked to death, and it was very unreasonable,"
but backed by the Duke we determined to try.</p>

<p>I told His Royal Highness I should put on my most
becoming Paris bonnet and beard the lion in his den.
He said, "Quite right, my dear, a man is always flattered
when a woman tries to please him," so accordingly about
3 Mrs. Phelps and I started for Scotland Yard. George
was rather surprised when I gave the order. We drove
through one or two courts and were stopped once by a
huge policeman, who let us go on when we said it was the
French Ambassadress. We were shown at once into Sir
Charles's room, and I must say he was charming, most
kind and courteous. We had arranged beforehand that
I was to be spokeswoman, and I went at once to the
point. He was sitting at his table with letters and papers
and telegrams, the telegraph ticking all the time, despatches
and telegrams being brought in, and as busy a
man as I ever saw. He immediately sent for maps of
the route, distribution of the troops, etc., and said he
thought he could manage it. We must have a light carriage
(of course we must go to the Abbey in state in the
gala coach) waiting at the Poets' Corner, as near the
door as it can get; he will send us a pass to break through
the lines, and will have three or four policemen waiting
for us at the corner of Piccadilly and one of the smaller
streets to pass us through the crowd. We really didn't
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_247" title="pg 247"> </a>
derange him very much. The whole conversation lasted
about ten minutes, and he was rather amused at this
sudden appearance of the two "femmes du monde" in his
"milieu" of clerks, policemen, telegraph boys, type-writers
and a hurrying, bustling crowd of employ&eacute;s of all
kinds. We returned triumphant to our respective
houses.</p>

<p>We had a fine reception last night at the Austrian Embassy
in honour of Prince Rudolph. We arrived late,
having dined out. The Prince is very good-looking,
slight, elegant figure, and charming manners and smile.
All the world was there&mdash;quantities of pretty women,
and pretty dresses&mdash;the Countess Karolyi always the
handsomest.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
June 20, 1887.</p>

<p>London is really a sight to-day, the streets gay with
flags, draperies, stands, illuminations, and quantities of
people gaping all day long. I went for a drive with
Mary Sheridan, daughter of Mr. Motley, late Minister
from the United States to the Court of St. James. We
didn't attempt going down Piccadilly, as we saw what a
dense crowd and block there was, so we crossed to Constitution
Hill. We went all round Westminster Abbey;
I wanted to see the Poets' Corner where we are to go in
to-morrow, and the House of Commons stand where she
is to be with her sister. We were blocked for a quarter
of an hour standing close to the Embankment. Some
of the mottoes are very nice. I like the humble ones best,
"God bless our Queen." We were a long time getting
back to the Embassy, Piccadilly almost impassable. It
was amusing, as everyone was arranging their balconies,
and we recognised various friends standing at windows,
and on balconies directing the arrangement of chairs,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_248" title="pg 248"> </a>
plants, flags, etc. After dinner W. took his cigar and we
walked about a little in Piccadilly. Some of the illuminations
had already begun and the crowd was dense, but
no jostling or roughs, everyone good-humoured and
wildly interested in the decorations. London is transformed
for the moment and looks like a great continental
city, all lights and flags and an "air de f&ecirc;te." We didn't
stay out very late, as we have a long day before us to-morrow.
They say the Queen is well, but rather "&eacute;mue"
and a little nervous, which must be expected. I shall
wear white, the only objection to that being that jewels
won't show out, as they would on a darker colour.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Albert Gate, London</span>,<br >
June 22, 1887.</p>

<p>I am still exhausted, Dear, with the visions of a brilliant,
motley, moving crowd, when I shut my eyes. Yesterday
was beautiful, a glorious summer day. I was
waked up at 6.30 by the dull rumble of carriages, and
people already on the move. I thought they must have
forgotten to call me, but the house was still wrapped in
slumber, and though it was only 6.30 the Park was full of
carriages, men in uniform and women in full dress. We
started at 9.30 in the gala carriage, W. in uniform, and
were followed by a second carriage, landau, the men
equally in gala. We remained blocked for a long time in
Piccadilly, it didn't seem possible to get on; distracted
policemen, mounted and on foot, and officers did what
they could, but there we remained, curiously enough
all the Ambassadors' carriages together. Finally an order
was given to let the Ambassadors' carriages pass,
and we got on a little. Various Court carriages passed
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_249" title="pg 249"> </a>
us&mdash;one so pretty with the three little daughters of the
Duke of Edinburgh all in white with straw hats, and long
white feathers, sitting on the back seat, and smiling and
bowing, and looking quite charming with their fair hair
streaming down their backs. They had an equerry in
uniform with them on the front seat. Once past St.
James's Street we went quickly enough thro' long lines
of soldiers, and behind them quantities of people waiting
patiently to see the great show. We went into the
Abbey at the Poets' Corner, where an entrance was reserved
for the Corps Diplomatique and Court functionaries.
It was a fine sight; tier upon tier of seats covered
with red cloth and filled with men in uniform, and women
in handsome dresses. The Peers and Peeresses sat just
below us and looked very well; as it was Collar Day, all
the Garter men wore their white shoulder-knots, which
were most effective. It was very difficult to distinguish
people, the building is so enormous, but as we were close
to the dais we saw all the Royalties perfectly. At last
various members of the Royal Family came in, and the
first Sovereign to enter was Her Majesty of the Sandwich
Islands with her cort&eacute;ge; then came quickly the
King of the Belgians, King of Denmark, various other
Princes, and they all took their places on a platform facing
the Queen's dais. We waited some time, and then
came a flourish of trumpets which announced the
Queen's arrival. It was most interesting to see her come
up the aisle&mdash;quite alone in front&mdash;her three sons, Wales,
Edinburgh, and Connaught, just behind her. She was
dressed in black with silver embroidery, a white lace bonnet
with feathers, and lace caught back by diamond pins.
As she reached the dais she stepped on it quite alone, and
advancing to the front made a pretty curtsey to the assembled
Royalties. Then came a long procession of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_250" title="pg 250"> </a>
family Princes, headed by the Prince of Wales and the
German Crown Prince, who looked magnificent in his
white uniform, and the Princess of Wales and the German
Crown Princess. They all passed before the Queen,
and it was most striking to see her seated there, a
quiet figure dressed in black, very composed and smiling,
yet "&eacute;mue" too, as the long line of children and
grandchildren representing all Europe passed to do her
homage. It was a gorgeous crowd of uniforms, orders,
jewels, and really <em>glittering</em> garments of all kinds; but
every eye was fixed on the central figure. The service
began at once and was impressive. The Prince Consort's
"Te Deum" sounded magnificent with organ and
full band. I must own to considerable distraction during
the service, as I was quite taken up with looking at
everything. When the ceremony was over&mdash;or nearly&mdash;we
started at once, found our carriage (ordinary
landau) at the Poets' Corner again, and drove quickly
around by Belgravia and Albert Gate (breaking the lines
of troops once or twice, but with no difficulty, as orders
had been given), to the corner of Hamilton Place and
Piccadilly. There we had to leave the carriage, but it
was merely a few steps to my friend's house where we
were to see the procession pass; however we should
never have got there if we hadn't found the 4 gigantic
policemen who were waiting for us, and who deposited
us rather pulled about, but intact, at the door. We
found the balcony prettily decorated and filled with
people, and had an excellent view of the procession. The
Queen's carriage was handsome, an open landau red and
gold, with six cream-coloured horses with red and gold
trappings, and running footmen. She was alone on the
back seat; the Princesses of Wales and Germany on the
front seat. The escort of Princes was very brilliant.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_251" title="pg 251"> </a>
The Prince of Wales looked well on a fine horse, and the
German Crown Prince superb, towering over everyone
else, and his helmet shining in the bright sunlight. The
cheering was tremendous as the Queen passed, and one
felt it was absolutely genuine (nothing command&eacute;), her
people (I always like that phrase so much, "My people,"
when she uses it in a speech or proclamation) really delighted
to have her still with them. Another who also
was much cheered was Princess Mary of Teck. They
love her, and she looked so happy and smiling as she acknowledged
the salutation. She has such a gracious
manner always to everyone&mdash;never seems bored. However
I must say that for the Prince of Wales; no matter
what the function is (and he must be bored very often)
he never looks it, but always does graciously, and as if
he liked it, whatever he undertakes. There was a very
substantial lunch provided for us at Lady Borthwick's,
and as soon as the cort&eacute;ge disappeared I clamoured for
something to eat, as it was nearly 3.30, and I had had
nothing to eat but my early cup of tea and piece of
toast about 8.30. I went straight back to the Embassy
after luncheon&mdash;even then, at 4 o'clock, we had to go
at a foot's pace thro' the crowd&mdash;and I didn't stir again
all the afternoon, but I had visitors at tea-time, as of
course the windows and balconies giving on the Park
were most attractive. There were thousands of people
still in the Park, and Royal carriages and escorts coming
and going; music, flags, and a general impression of
movement and colour everywhere.</p>

<p>In the evening we started at 10 for the Palace, and
they thought there would be such a crowd that we had a
mounted policeman, but we had no trouble. Everyone
made way for the carriage, though, of course, the general
traffic was stopped, and everybody (including our own
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_252" title="pg 252"> </a>
secretaries, who weren't invited to the Palace, merely
the "chefs de mission") in the middle of the streets, looking
at the illuminations. There was great confusion at
the Palace&mdash;dinners still going on and servants hurrying
backward and forward with dishes, and piles of plates on
the floor as we passed through the long corridor. We
had to pass through the great hall where the numerous
"suites" were dining&mdash;and we naturally hesitated a moment
as they were still at table&mdash;but Colonel Byng came
forward and ushered us upstairs, and into one of the
large rooms. There were very few people&mdash;the "chefs
de mission," the Nunzio who had come expressly, Lord
and Lady Salisbury, and Lord C., Indian Secretary
(as there were many Indian Princes). We waited nearly
an hour and were then summoned to the ball-room,
where the Queen and Court were assembled. The
Queen was standing, dressed just as she always is for
a Drawing-room, with her small diamond crown and
veil, and again the background of Princes and uniforms
made a striking contrast to the one black-robed
figure. The Prince of Wales stood a little behind, on
her right, also Lord Lathom (Lord Chamberlain). We
all passed before her, two by two, with our husbands, and
she said a few words to each one, but no real conversation;
it was evidently an effort, and we felt we must not
stay a moment longer than necessary. I talked to one
or two people while the others were passing. The German
Crown Princess came over and talked to us. I
asked her if the Queen was very tired. She said not
nearly as much as she expected, it was more the anticipation
of the day that had made her nervous, that she was
very agitated when she started, but that wore off, and
she was not very tired this evening, and very happy, as
were all her children, I said, "You might add her
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_253" title="pg 253"> </a>
people, Madam, for I never saw such a splendid outburst
of loyalty." The Crown Princess herself is perfectly delightful,
so clever and cultivated, and so easy, with such
beautiful, clear, smiling eyes. Do you remember how
much I admired her in Rome the first time I met her?
She is always so kind to us. W. loves to talk to her;
they don't always agree, but she quite understands people
having their own opinions, rather prefers it, I think, as
she must necessarily be so often thrown with people who
never venture to disagree with her. The Crown Prince
of Sweden also came and recalled himself to me, and the
Duc d'Aoste. The Queen remained about an hour; then
the Royal party moved off in procession, and we got our
carriages as quickly as we could. I have written you a
volume (but you must say that doesn't happen often from
my lazy pen, but I felt I must write at once, or I should
never have the courage). Please send the letter to the
family in America. I am dead tired, and my eyes shutting
by themselves.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, June 22, 1887.</p>

<p>We went this afternoon with the Florians, Comte de
Florian, Secretary of the Embassy, and Comtesse de
Florian, Francis, Baroness Hilda Deichmann and her
children and some of the Embassy men, to the children's
f&ecirc;te in Hyde Park. It was very pretty, and very
well arranged; 30,000 children from all parts of London,
and amusements, food, and jubilee mugs provided
for all. We got there a little after 3, and it was warm
and fatiguing standing and walking about. There were
various refreshment tents for the "quality committee,"
etc., and the children got iced cream and cakes to their
hearts' content, also each a jubilee mug with which they
were much pleased. The Prince and Princess of Wales,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_254" title="pg 254"> </a>
with some of the foreign Princes, came about 4 (and
horribly bored the foreigners looked&mdash;naturally). We
stood and walked about until 6, when the Queen arrived.
Her procession was rather pretty, just a troop of
mounted police, then the Life Guards, the Indian
contingent, and the Queen in an open carriage with
4 horses, the postilions in black, and two Highland
servants in costume behind. The Crown Princess of
Germany, Princess Christian, and Duke of Edinburgh
in the carriage with her; and the Duke of Cambridge
(Ranger of the Park) riding at the porti&egrave;re. Several
Royal carriages followed, all the women in smart
clothes, and the men in uniform, as the Queen was
to make her formal Jubilee entr&eacute;e into Windsor on
leaving London after the f&ecirc;te. There was such a press
and jostling when the Queen came&mdash;even the women
pushing and struggling to get to the front, that I should
have been nearly crushed with the two children (I had
Hilda and Francis with me) if Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar
hadn't recognised me and come to my rescue.
He is very tall and broad, so he made way for me, put the
children in front, and then stood behind me so that no one
could get at me. I must say it was a fine struggle, the
ladies used their arms valiantly. A small slight woman
would have had no show at all. The Queen didn't get
out of her carriage. The Prince stood bareheaded at the
carriage door all the time the Queen was there, and various
people were brought up and presented to her. I
found plenty of people to talk to, among others the German
Crown Prince, who they say is in a very bad way;
he doesn't look changed, perhaps a little thinner, but the
voice has gone. He spoke in a whisper. He noticed the
children, said Francis was very like his father. I told
him Hilda was a little compatriote, and named her to him.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_255" title="pg 255"> </a>
He knows her parents well. The Queen was much
cheered as she drove off; then there were more cheers for
the Prince, who acknowledged them most graciously, as
he does always. We had again rather a struggle to get
through the crowd and across to the Embassy, and then
at 6.30 I had some tea, got into a tea-gown, and refused
to move again. W. tried to entice me to the Foreign
Office where there was a big reception, but I was utterly
incapable of another word (the heat always tries me so);
so he departed sadly, but didn't stay long&mdash;merely
showed himself. He said the crowd was awful, and Lord
Cranborne, the son of the house, in a wild state on the
stairs, with his supper list, as he couldn't find half the
people. W. told him not to worry about us, as he was
going home, and I was in bed.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
June 24, 1887.</p>

<p>Yesterday I had rather a quiet day, I was still so dead
tired after the children's f&ecirc;te. Jean and I drove about
in the afternoon. She wanted to see the "Black
Queen," as the Queen of the Sandwich Islands is called,
and we crossed her once or twice driving in the Park.
It does look funny to see her sitting up in the Royal carriage
with red liveries. We had a beautiful ball last
night, given by Lord and Lady Rosebery at Lansdowne
House for all the Royalties. The House was beautifully
arranged; the ballroom panelled half way up the wall
with red roses and green leaves. I danced a quadrille with
the King of Greece, who is easy and talks a great deal;
he speaks English perfectly well. He asked about the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_256" title="pg 256"> </a>
Schuylers, and spoke most warmly of them&mdash;said Schuyler
was one of the few perfectly intelligent men he had
ever met, "knew everything about everything," I must
write it to them. The supper was very well arranged,
small tables of eight or ten. Almost all the Royalties
were there, but not the Hawaiian Queen. I asked our
host why he hadn't invited Queen Kapiolani; but he said
he really couldn't. The ball was small, and Lady Rosebery
left out many of her friends, who naturally were not
pleased. W. actually stayed to supper&mdash;I was so surprised,
as he hates it.</p>

<p class="author">June 24, 1887.</p>

<p>This afternoon all the swells went to Ranelagh to see
a polo match, but I thought I would reserve myself for
the Palace Ball. The Queen didn't appear, but we had
two others, the Queen of the Belgians, and always Kapiolani.
It was badly managed at first, the result being that
when the Court came we had a crowd of people, officers,
pages, etc., about four deep in front of us, so that we
could neither see nor be seen, nor hardly move. When
the first "quadrille d'honneur" was being danced we saw
nothing, so after a consultation we all left the ball-room.
Then there were various "pourparlers," and they finally
did what they should have done at first, enlarged the
circle, so that we were out of the crowd and near the
Court. There was also a great rush at supper, so that they
had to shut one door for a moment. I didn't see many
people to talk to, but of course it was very difficult. The
Grand Duchess Serge looked beautiful, with splendid emeralds
(she is the daughter of Princess Alice), and the
Duchesse de Braganza (daughter of the Comte de Paris)
was charming, so very high-bred, tall and slight, with a
pretty little dark head. I always find the Princess of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_257" title="pg 257"> </a>
Wales the most distinguished looking. She stands out
everywhere. Our "Doyenne," Countess Karolyi, was
superb&mdash;also with magnificent jewels. The Indian
Princes made a great show, of course, with their silk,
heavily embroidered tuniques, and the quantities of jewels,
but they are not often well cut, nor well set, and they
themselves are certainly off color&mdash;they look barbarians,
and have such false faces&mdash;I wouldn't trust one of them.</p>

<p>It is delicious summer weather now, and yesterday we
went to Buckingham Palace to see the Queen review the
Volunteers. I wore for the first time my Jubilee Medal.
It came Friday with a note from the Duchess of Roxburghe
saying the Queen hoped I would wear it as a
souvenir of her Jubilee. It is a plain little silver medal
about the size of a two-shilling piece, with the Queen's
head on one side and an inscription on the other, fastened
to a bow of blue and white ribbon. We three Ambassadresses
are the only women of the Corps Diplomatique
that have it. All the Queen's household have it, Duchesses
of Bedford, Buccleuch, Roxburghe, etc. The
Princesses, also, of course, but theirs are in gold.</p>

<p>It was most amusing waiting in the courtyard of the
Palace seeing everyone arrive. All the Royalties took up
their positions at the foot of the Queen's tribune, and
waited for her. Our tribune was on one side of hers, and
one for the Indian Princes opposite. The Volunteers
looked and passed very well; as it was Saturday afternoon
and the shops in London are closed early always
Saturday, all the various butchers, bakers, and candle-stick-makers
could leave their shops and parade, and extremely
well some of them looked; stout, heavy men
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_258" title="pg 258"> </a>
moving quite lightly and at ease in their stiff uniforms.
It was pretty to see the various Princes break away from
their places on the Duke of Cambridge's staff and ride
ahead of the various regiments of which they are honorary
colonels. The Prince of Wales looked well on his
handsome chestnut, which is perfectly trained and steps
beautifully. The Duke of Connaught is a handsome soldier.
We were a long time getting away, but as we had
no dinner-party it wasn't of any consequence. It was
such a pleasure not to put on a low bodice and diamonds.
I always grumble about putting on my diadem&mdash;as a rule
I never wear anything in my hair, not even feathers (except
at Court), and the diadem is heavy. After dinner
W. and I went for a drive along the Thames Embankment&mdash;our
favourite recreation after a long, hot day.
There are still people about, and a general air of festivity.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
July 21, 1887.</p>

<p>It is just four years to-day since W. came to London.
We got back from Moscow and the Coronation the 6th,
and almost immediately the Minister offered W. London.
My "beau-fr&egrave;re" said he would give us two years when
we came over. I wonder how much longer it will last.
We had a big dinner to-night, and Lord Lathom, the
Lord Chamberlain, was next to me. He said no one
could imagine how difficult it had been to arrange everything
for the Jubilee ceremonies; that the Queen was
consulted <em>on every point</em>, as she knew more about
etiquette and court ceremonies than anyone else. One
day he had 42 telegrams from her. We told him we
thought everything was well managed (except the ball,
where all the young officers crowded in front of us, and
stepped on our toes, and on our trains). He quite admitted
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_259" title="pg 259"> </a>
that that might have been better done, but also
remarked that he thought the Corps Diplomatique a little
exacting; so, as usual, there are two sides to every
question.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
July 25, 1887.</p>

<p>We have had a nice outing, Dear, thanks to the Naval
Review; two such beautiful interesting days. I am
burned brown as a berry, but, as the season is over, that
is of no consequence, and I shall have plenty of time at
Bourneville to bleach. We started Saturday at 9.30 for
Portsmouth with the Florians, Waru, and R., Naval Attach&eacute;,
in a special train. The harbour looked so pretty
as we came in sight of it. Every description of vessel
(even the "Victory," Nelson's old ship, now a training
ship), and all sorts of ironclads, big steamers, yachts, and
the smallest sort of pleasure-boat, dressed with flags. We
went at once on board the "Helicon," a small despatch
boat, especially destined to the Corps Diplomatique and
distinguished strangers. There were about 150 people
on board, all colleagues, also the Arch Duke Regnier of
Austria, and the two young sons of the Duc d'Aoste with
their suites. Directly after us came two great English
transports painted white, one for the Lords, and one for
the Commons, and all around us a fleet of ordinary
rowing-boats and barges filled with people&mdash;quantities
of women and children. We steamed slowly
across the Solent to Osborne to meet the Queen,
and passed close to the great ironclads, which looked
monsters, and formidable ones. We had a handsome
substantial lunch on board, to which we all did
honour. There were not many foreign ships. Our
two looked very well and were much admired, an old
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_260" title="pg 260"> </a>
frigate, the "Iphig&eacute;nie," now a training ship, with the
midshipmen on board, and the "&Eacute;lan," a pretty little despatch
boat. There were only two other foreign boats:
a German and a Dutchman. The Italian ships put into
Spithead, and then went off to Dartmouth, no one knows
why exactly. Some say they were not satisfied with their
place (they arrived after the French ships, and would
have been decidedly farther off, and behind ours), others
that they were not in good condition, not smart enough;
however, they were not there and the Italian Princesses
who had expected to sleep on board, and meet their
brother who is on one of the ships, were much disgusted.
As soon as the "Osborne," with the Queen, the Prince of
Wales, and the King of Greece (we didn't understand
the Greek flag at first, as we didn't know the King was
on board), had passed, we followed and went down the
line. It was a beautiful sight, and England could certainly
be proud of her great ironclads filling the harbour,
and showing her strength as a naval power. We went
slowly, and it was amusing to hear the criticisms and
appreciations of all the assembled foreigners on the show&mdash;however,
I suppose all ironclads now are pretty much
alike, only England happens to have three times as many
as any of the rest of us. About 6 o'clock there was a
halt. We of course had tea on deck, and suddenly we
saw quantities of steam launches coming across the water
in all directions. They looked like enormous white birds
in the distance. They were almost all white, low in the
water, and going very fast. The captains of all the ships
had been called on board the Queen's yacht to be received
by her. This made a long delay, and our colleagues were
getting impatient, as they foresaw that they would be
very late in getting back to London. We took that opportunity
to ask the Captain of the "Helicon" to bear
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_261" title="pg 261"> </a>
down toward the "Iphig&eacute;nie," as we were to dine and
sleep on board. We changed our course a little, and in
about 10 minutes two very smart French boats ran alongside,
coming up in grand style. The three English officers
stood on the bridge and helped us off, and I must say
it was all done admirably&mdash;not the slightest confusion,
and we were a big party. Our fellow-passengers decidedly
envied us. The Bylandts (Dutch Minister) were
much put out. They had asked the Captain of their ship
to let them dine and sleep on board, but he refused absolutely;
said he had just arrived from a long cruise, and
was not prepared to receive anyone. We got to the
"Iphig&eacute;nie" in about 15 minutes. The Commandant,
Noccomore, was standing on the bridge. W. got out
first, then T., and as soon as W. put his foot on the
deck, where all the sailors, officers, and midshipmen were
drawn up, there was a salute of drums and clarions (they
couldn't give the regular salute of guns to the Ambassador,
as, when the Queen is in the harbour, no one else
can be saluted). The Commandant gave me his arm,
and we went at once to his quarters (or rather "carr&eacute;," as
they say on board ship). We passed through a fine room
or hall, the entire width of the frigate, where a good-sized
dinner-table was ready. The Commandant asked when
we would dine; we said in a "quart d'heure," just the time
to wash our faces, which were black with smoke and red
with sun, and he showed W. and me our quarters (his
of course), and most comfortable. The cabin large,
with a wardrobe, and a large "cabinet de toilette," with
English wash-stand, bath-room, etc. For one person it
was perfectly roomy. Of course when a second bed was
put in the "cabinet de toilette" it was a little small.
Mmes. de Florian and Heurtel had the second officer's
cabin, and the men hammocks in some part of the ship.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_262" title="pg 262"> </a></p>

<p>The dinner was good and handsome. I had the
"Aum&ocirc;nier" on the other side of me. He was intelligent,
ready to talk about anything, and the dinner was
very agreeable. Plenty of talk. W. talked a great deal,
and the naval officers were interesting, as they always
are. They have seen so much, and had such varied experiences.
After dinner we had coffee in the Commandant's
salon, and then went on deck, where we spent a
delightful evening. The sea was perfectly calm, not a
ripple, and lights everywhere&mdash;all the ships illuminated
and sending off fireworks at intervals. We could hardly
see our own, but the little "&Eacute;lan" looked very smart and
natty. We broke up about 11, and I don't know when
I have enjoyed anything so much as that perfectly quiet
summer night on the water; such a rest after the long
day, and early start from London. We promised to be
ready at a quarter to 10 for Mass, and the visit of the
ship. You would have been amused to see how well
Drejet did my service (they asked me if I could do without
my maid for one night, as they really didn't know
what to do with her). He told Adela&iuml;de he could do
everything for me except my hair, and tying my sash,
which seemed to be a serious performance to him, and
really all my dressing things were put out and a "saut de
lit" disposed gracefully over the back of a chair just as
A. always did. I supposed she coached him. I was stirring
early enough the next morning, but I couldn't tie my
sash either, so I wandered out on the deck to have my
early tea, and Countess de Florian helped me to finish
my toilette. We went all over the ship before Mass.
The midshipmen's quarters are small, but of course beautifully
kept, and the young men all looked as smiling
and prosperous as possible, and were much pleased at the
Ambassador's visit. At 10 o'clock we assembled on deck
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_263" title="pg 263"> </a>
for Mass. Part of the deck was covered in with flags,
and as a compliment to my nationality they had put the
"Stars and Stripes" immediately over my head. I was
much pleased, as it is a good many years since I have sat
under the old flag. I suppose I can't say <em>my flag</em> any
more, but I feel it all the same. There were three armchairs
directly in front of the altar&mdash;two big ones for
W. and me and a smaller one between for the Commandant.34

As soon as we were seated the Abb&eacute; came, made a
bow to W. and me, and began his Mass. It was very
impressive&mdash;so still, not a sound except the little waves
beating against the side of the ship, and the word of
command for the marines at the raising of the Host, when
there was a fine salute of drums and bugles. We had a
very gay breakfast, the Captain of the "&Eacute;lan" coming
to join us, and at 1 o'clock we left our hospitable frigate
for the "&Eacute;lan" which was going to cruise about with us
all the afternoon. They certainly received us most hospitably
and charmingly; I shall often think of those
quiet hours on the deck, and the Mass this morning, which
impressed me very much. We had a lovely afternoon on
the "&Eacute;lan," practically doing the Review over again, and
going close up to the big ironclads, such ugly, heavy
masses as they seem when one is near them. We crossed
over to Cowes, went alongside of the Prince of Wales'
yacht, but didn't stop. The captain gave us an interesting
account of their reception on the "Osborne." It
seems there was some mistake in the orders brought by
the Aide-de-Camp of the Admiral of the Fleet. The
Commandant of the "Iphig&eacute;nie" thought he could
take several officers with him, and when he appeared
on the "Osborne" with 5 or 6 officers, the Admiral
was much embarrassed, and didn't know what to do,
as the Queen intended to receive only the Commandants.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_264" title="pg 264"> </a>
However the Prince of Wales, with his never-failing
tact, said he would put it all right, and in a
few moments they were told that the Queen would
be very pleased to receive <em>all</em> the French officers.
They told us they saw a lady in deep mourning, with
perfectly white hair, standing behind the Queen, who
looked so earnestly at the French uniforms, and was
agitated when they passed; they only realised afterward
that it was the Empress.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="r9">[9]</a></sup> I wonder if I shall ever see
her, I would like to so much. We dined on board,
anchored just off Portsmouth, and got back to London
about 11 o'clock, having enjoyed our two days immensely.
It was a beautiful ending to the Jubilee, and
a beautiful sight. The "cadre" was so lovely for all
those big ships. All the line of the Isle of Wight is so
pretty, beautifully green, and the Solent covered with
boats of all descriptions, and plenty of room for all.
Some of the small row-boats seemed dangerously near
the big steamers, but nothing ever happened. When I
get back to Bourneville and take up my quiet life in the
woods, these last days will seem a sort of fairy-tale.</p>

<p>We are starting to-morrow. I had a farewell ride this
morning, hardly anyone in the Row, Dandy going beautifully
(you know he is the chestnut I called after the
famous horse in one of Charlie's stories), except a good
kick from time to time, which is a bore, not only for me
(I lost my hat the other day), but for the neighbours.
We dined at Lord A.'s last night, and he gave us a funny
account of his experience on the House of Lords boat.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_265" title="pg 265"> </a>
To begin with he had much difficulty in getting tickets,
and could get none for his daughters, only himself and
Lady A. (and he is Hereditary Lord Chamberlain), and
when he finally did get on the boat he found it crowded
with all sorts of unknown people, very few peers, and
very little food. They were faint with hunger before
the end of the day, so I told him about our handsome
dinner and hospitable reception on our frigate. Bylandt
then told us how badly they fared. They cruised about
for some time in the "Helicon" after we got off, then
finally the passengers begged to be landed. They were at
last deposited at Portsmouth, and then made a rush for
the buffet in the railway station, but that had been completely
"devalis&eacute;," there wasn't a crumb, not even a dry
biscuit. Then they were conducted with much pomp to
reserved carriages which were <em>locked</em>, and there they remained
for over an hour, seeing various trains start, and
at last arrived in London at one o'clock in the morning.
Poor Bylandt was much disgusted. We thought a little
of asking to keep the "&Eacute;lan" for a week, and of doing the
Cowes week, but W. thought on the whole it would be
close quarters, and was not very keen about it. I should
have liked it. We had all the staff who remain to dine
to-night. London is curiously empty&mdash;all the chairs
being taken away from the Park, which gives it a decided
air of "fin de saison."</p>

<p>I have been back about two weeks and am quite settled
again. I have always two or three disagreeable days
when I first come back from France. The coal fires try
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_266" title="pg 266"> </a>
me very much and I think regretfully of the enormous
chimneys at Bourneville and the <em>trees</em> that we burned
there. We have a fog and it is very cold. Francis and
I went to skate yesterday at the Botanical Gardens. The
ice was very bad, there was very little room, and swarms
of children struggling along on their little skates, but the
outing was pleasant. I also went one day with a friend
to Wimbledon, and that was better. We drove down
and had a pleasant afternoon, but the ice was soft, and
it was the end. Really though, in March in England,
one could hardly expect to skate.</p>

<p class="author">March 8th.</p>

<p>Hilda came in this morning with very bad news of the
German Emperor. The Crown Prince was to start from
the Riviera, and I am afraid he is in a bad way too. He
looked such a magnificent man at the Jubilee F&ecirc;tes. Of
course even then his voice and colour showed that something
was wrong, but it was difficult to believe that a
mortal disease was mining his strength. We have had
telegrams all the afternoon, and at 5 they told us the
Emperor was dead. We sent immediately to Mrs. Jeune,
where we were engaged to dine to meet Prince and
Princess Christian of Schleswig-Holstein, to know if her
dinner was put off; but the answer came back that the
dinner was to take place. We went of course, and found
Princess Christian and Lady Salisbury. Prince Christian,
as a German Prince and a relation of the German
Royal Family, did not come; neither did Lord Salisbury,
who had received a telegram from Berlin announcing the
Emperor's death. The Princess looked anxious and was
evidently very much worried at the journey of the Crown
Prince in such weather, in his delicate state. She left almost
instantly after dinner. The Drawing-room is postponed.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_267" title="pg 267"> </a>
The Crown Prince starts to-morrow morning.
All eyes are upon him, and will follow his journey with
hopes and fears.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, March 18th.</p>

<p>We all went to the funeral service for the German Emperor
this morning in the German Lutheran Chapel close
to Marlborough House. I was quite correct this time,
and was swathed in cr&ecirc;pe; Mrs. Lecky has lent me her
long cr&ecirc;pe veil, which will serve again probably, as everyone
seems to think the Emperor Frederick is doomed. All
the men were in uniform with cr&ecirc;pe on their sleeves and
sword hilts (the Germans with their helmets covered with
cr&ecirc;pe) and the women in woollen dresses with cr&ecirc;pe veils.
Almost all the Princesses were there (not the Princess of
Wales), but the Princes were in Berlin. The service was
long, and curiously enough was <em>not</em> the Lutheran service,
but the regular Church of England service translated into
German. It was done, it seems, for George II, who was
obliged to follow the Church of England service, and
who didn't understand a <em>word</em> of English. There was
much chanting, two addresses, and a sermon.</p>

<p>Everyone of course is talking and speculating over
what will happen in Germany. All the doctors say the
Emperor Frederick is near his end. No one seems to
know exactly what will be the attitude of the present
Crown Prince. He is young, intelligent, with an iron
will; all good qualities in a sovereign, but he has little
experience and an absolute confidence in his own judgment.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, April 25, 1888.</p>

<p>We hear a great deal now here about Boulanger, and
there seems to be the most extraordinary "engouement"
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_268" title="pg 268"> </a>
for him here as well as in France. Roustan, the Naval
Attach&eacute;, has just come back from Paris and says the state
of things is very serious, people have lost their heads
over Boulanger. He (R.) thinks it is the most serious
crisis France has passed through since the Commune.
W. is less blue&mdash;he knows the famous General very little,
but doesn't think there is much character or backbone
there.</p>

<p>We had a big dinner the other night at Lord Rothschild's,
and Lord Hartington, a well-known political and
social figure, sat between me and the Princesse de Wagram.
He naturally asked us, the only two Frenchwomen
at table, what we thought of Boulanger. The Princess
spoke most enthusiastically of him. The one man in
France who could regenerate the country, and who would
be supported by all parties. I said exactly the contrary,
and that I thought his popularity and power very much
exaggerated. Lord Hartington was rather amused at
the two opinions so absolutely at variance.</p>

<p>The Deichmanns came to see us the other day, just
back from Berlin, and in despair over the Emperor.
Deichmann said he came into the room with the same
straight, soldierly bearing he had always had, and except
that he was thinner, looked unchanged; but he
couldn't speak, and his friends fear the worst. He is
worried too over the friction between the Empress and
Bismarck&mdash;too such strong wills in conflict.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,
April 26, 1888.</p>

<p>I wonder if you are as cold as I am to-day. I have
been driving about shivering in the open carriage and my
seal-skin felt like a foulard. I think I got cold last night.
We had a pleasant dinner at Lord Knutsford's. I had
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_269" title="pg 269"> </a>
Count Kufstein next to me. He was for years in Paris
at the Austrian Embassy just when I was first married
and making my d&eacute;but in the official world. He is here
now for the sugar conference, and we were delighted to
go back to old times, as he knows everybody in Paris of
all kinds: Imperialists, Royalists, and Republicans. It
wasn't always easy for a foreigner to get along and not
offend somebody. On our way home W. suggested that
we should go in for a moment to the W. H. Smiths' who
had a big political reception. In a weak moment I
agreed. It is not really necessary to go to those big
parties&mdash;one can be written down in the book by one of
the secretaries, or give the names to the lady of the
<em>Morning Post</em> who sits with her hat and coat behind
the door, and puts down as many names as she can manage.
I should think she would have perpetual rheumatism,
as the hall door is open and the draught something
awful. The moment I set my foot in the hall my heart
sank, such a crowd on the stairs, I should think all the
House of Commons and all their female relations. There
was a double current going and coming, and I was thankful
not to have my dress torn to bits. We met Tom
Leigh coming down. He said he had been 15 minutes
on the same step. However we did manage to get upstairs&mdash;tried
to find either host or hostess, but they had
evidently left the door&mdash;so after struggling through one
or two rooms packed tight with people I discovered a
high wooden stool behind one of the doors which had
evidently been used for lighting the candles and been
forgotten, so I seated myself on that and told W. I
would wait for him there, as he thought he would
try and find some one of the family. I sat there
some little time rather interested in the stream of
perfectly unknown faces which passed until I was
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_270" title="pg 270"> </a>
rescued by Correa, the Brazilian Minister, who couldn't
believe that it was really the French Ambassadress
sitting alone on a three-legged stool behind the door.
W. came back in about a quarter of an hour not
having seen any one he knew, and then we started down
the staircase where we had the same struggle, and the
cold air blowing in upon my bare shoulders. I was cross
when I got home&mdash;however I suppose exactly the same
thing happens when we have a big reception, as the Embassy
is not nearly large enough. The other night when
the Duke of Cambridge dined with us we had a party
afterward. W. went down to the door with him and
never got up again, there was such a crowd on the stairs.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, May 19, 1888.</p>

<p>The season is animated enough and we are out every
night (not all day, as so many people are, as we refuse
all lunches and teas). Our music the other evening with
Wolff, the young Dutch violinist, and Mdme. Kleeberg,
was nice. We had invited only about 50 people, all musical.
Everyone could sit down (which the men appreciated,
as they usually <em>stand</em> in the doorway all through
the concert), and also we were not obliged to have those
rows of gilt chairs which grate so on my nerves. I know
the women hate it so when they are all seated in rows
very close to each other and not a man anywhere near.
Wolff played divinely, with so much tone and sentiment.
He had a great success. Mdme. Kleeberg always plays
beautifully. She is well known here and much liked. It
was the first time Wolff had played in London, and he
was a little nervous.</p>

<p>Last night we dined with Lady Delawarr to meet
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_271" title="pg 271"> </a>
Princess Louise and Lord Lorne. The Princess is
charming; a pretty, graceful figure and attractive manner,
absolutely what the Italians would call "simpatica."
Lord Lorne took me to dinner, and I found him most
entertaining and original. He talked a great deal about
Canada and America, and certainly knows and appreciates
"the States." He said if he hadn't been born the eldest
son of an English Duke he would certainly emigrate to
the West of America and pitch his tent there.</p>

<p>There was a reception and music in the evening, Wolff
playing beautifully, but, alas! no one listening. Lady
Borthwick (who is a good musician) and I moved into
the large drawing-room at his request when he began to
play, and I really don't think anyone else scarcely listened,
and certainly no one realised when, after playing a few
moments under great difficulty (people coming and going
and talking all the time), he calmly laid his violin on the
piano and stopped. He came up to me to explain, what
I quite understood, that he could hear neither his own
violin nor the accompaniment, and I could not urge him
to continue. It is very hard on the artists, an evening
like that. If they don't play well, everyone criticises; and
if they stop altogether, people think it is high-handed,
and criticise equally. I have learnt now by experience
and never invite <em>many</em> people when I have music.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant evening last night at Sir Arthur
Sullivan's who had a dinner for the Prince of Wales and
the Duke and Duchess Paul of Mecklenburg. There
were all kinds of artists&mdash;singing, reciting, and dancing.
An American girl, with a very pretty voice, sang very
well, and Letty Lind was charming. The Duchess Paul
looked very pretty and chic, and was most amiable. The
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_272" title="pg 272"> </a>
Prince is so nice to artists&mdash;always a gracious word and
smile. Sullivan is an excellent host, and keeps everything
going. Just as we arrived the electric light went
out. I couldn't imagine why the house looked so dark
as we drove up, for I knew the Prince was dining, and
there was the red carpet which always indicates Royalty,
so there could be no mistake, but the hall-door was open
and lamps and candles being brought in from all quarters.
We took off our cloaks in the dark, but in a very few
minutes things were put right, and the rooms brilliantly
illuminated. W. never remains long on these occasions,
but I stayed until the end, even for supper, which was
very gay.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, May 24, 1888.</p>

<p>My small musical tea for the Duchess Paul was very
successful I think yesterday. I could not have Johannes
Wolff, the violinist, which I regretted extremely. He
plays quite beautifully, with so much "entrain" and sentiment.
I think I have already written to you about him,
he is a Dutchman who was sent to me by Mdme. de Zuylen
(you remember Zuylen who was so long Dutch Minister
in Paris). It was a little discouraging at first, there
is such a tremendous concurrence in London, and English
people like to hear the same artists, whom they know
well; Joachim, Sarasate, and Mdme. Neruda have it all
their own way. However, I made a small party for him,
all musical people, Lady Borthwick, Mrs. Ronalds, Tosti,
Lord Lathom, etc., and he conquered his public at once.
It was splendid playing and a style quite his own. We
replaced him by Mdme. Le Valloit, who plays very well;
and had besides Picolellis (from Florence), who plays
well (cello), and Carpe, the Italian baritone who has a
big voice and sings in the Italian style. The audience
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_273" title="pg 273"> </a>
listened pretty well at first, then came tea and the clatter
of tea-cups in the blue room where all the jeunesse had
congregated, talking and laughing and having their tea
with a fine unconsciousness of the music going on in the
next room. They are really very tiresome. That reminds
me of Grieg who was very "difficile," and who
couldn't stand a sound when he was playing. He and his
wife came to the Embassy one night and played and sang
quite charmingly, and everybody was delighted. Quite
at the last moment one of the Royalties talked a little
while he was playing, and I saw the moment when he
would get up from the piano. However, Wolff and I between
us managed to calm him. When it was over I told
him what a success he had had&mdash;that the Prince had enjoyed
his playing so much, to which he replied&mdash;"Ja, der
hat es laut gesagt."</p>

<p>Duchess Paul was very amiable, stayed until after 7
and seemed to enjoy it; at least she listened and spoke
very nicely to the artists afterward. I had just time to
dress for a dinner at the Austrian Embassy.</p>

<p class="author">May 26, 1888.</p>

<p>We dined to-night with our cousins the Ivor Herberts,
a dinner for the Duke and Duchess Paul of Mecklenburg.
We were asked for 8.15, and they never came until 9,
looking quite unconcerned. I can't imagine how the
cooks manage. Juteau tears his hair when we are so late,
but he is getting accustomed to English hours now, and
doesn't get ready himself until a quarter of an hour after
the time fixed. We were a perfect bore to all our friends
at first with our French punctuality, and arrived once or
twice before the master of the house. W. consulted Lord
Granville, who told him his rule was to leave his house
<em>at the hour named for the dinner</em>; but as we dine sometimes
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_274" title="pg 274"> </a>
around the corner, and sometimes at Kensington that is
not always practical. People in Paris are very punctual
and never wait more than a quarter of an hour for anyone.
I remember quite well when I was first married, and my
husband was a Cabinet Minister, being late for dinner at
Comte Paul de S&eacute;gur's. When we arrived they were at
table. Among the guests was the Duc d'Audifret-Pasquier,
President of the Senate&mdash;he had arrived in time
and they wouldn't keep him waiting more than the "quart
d'heure de gr&acirc;ce." I was very much surprised, as after
all my husband was a personage, but I must say I think
the rule is a good one. I was next to the Duke and found
him very pleasant. He is a brother of the Grand Duchess
Wladimir, and he talked about the Coronation, and
some of the curious, half barbaric ceremonies. He had
been lunching at Sheen with the Comte de Paris, and was
much impressed with the dull, sad look of the place. It
does look gloomy, enclosed in high walls, such a contrast
to Eu and the beautiful, bright sunny homes where the
Orl&eacute;ans Princes spent their childish years.</p>

<p>To-night we have a quiet evening, and are glad to have
a chance to talk over Boulanger (who is coming here)
and various troublesome questions. We dined last night
with the Duchess of Westminster to meet Princess Mary
and the Duke of Teck. The dinner was handsome and
pleasant, and there was a small ball afterward. They
danced in the picture gallery, a beautiful, large room,
where the dresses and jewels showed to great advantage.
We didn't stay very late as W. never dances, not even
the regulation "Quadrille d'Honneur" at Court. He and
Karolyi are the only diplomatists who never dance.</p>

<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, June 5, 1888.</p>

<p>Yesterday was a beautiful summer day, the ideal Sunday
of Bishop Keble&mdash;"The bridal of the earth and sky."
We walked through the "Church Parade" coming back
from Westminster. There were quantities of pretty girls
dotted about the Park, looking so fresh and cool in their
white dresses. I had various visits. Sunday is the <em>man's</em>
day in London, and the afternoon is generally interesting.
The Spanish Ambassador came in. He had been lunching
at Sheen with the Comte de Paris, and told me that
the Prince asked him if he had seen his Coll&egrave;gue de
France lately, and what <em>he</em> thought of the state of things
in France, and particularly what he thought of Boulanger.
I told him I didn't think the French Ambassador shared
the Comte de Paris' enthusiasm for that hero, but that
<em>he</em> had better ask him.</p>

<p>About 5.30 W. and I started for White Lodge, Richmond
Park, to dine with Princess Mary and the Duke
of Teck. We found quite a party assembled in the garden
around a tea-table, the Princess making the tea
herself, Princess May and some of the young ones helping.
The talk was pleasant and easy, Princess Mary is
a charming hostess and <em>likes</em> to talk (which is certainly
not the case with all English women). She is very stout,
but has a beautiful head and fine presence. Tosti and
Picolellis dined, and played divinely after dinner. The
evening was enchanting. We all sat in the big drawing-room
opening on the garden. There was not much light,
the moon shining through the trees, and the two artists
playing as if inspired anything anyone asked for, from
a Spohr sonata to an Italian canzonetta. I thought we
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_276" title="pg 276"> </a>
should stay there all night&mdash;no one wanted to go home.
The drive home was lovely, the London streets are so
quiet Sunday night.</p>

<p class="author">June 6th.</p>

<p>This morning was the great meet of the coaches, and
our terrace of course is in great request as it gives directly
on the Park. It is always a pretty sight as everyone
turns out. Lord Fife had the Prince of Wales with
him, and the Princess was driving about with her three
daughters in a victoria. The news of the German Emperor
is very bad.</p>

<p class="author">June 10th.</p>

<p>This afternoon we had lovely music at Frank
Schuster's. Both Wolff and Hollman played divinely.
They are great rivals, both Dutchmen, and both great
favourites (Hollman is 'cello). A trio with them and
Mdme. Kleeberg at the piano is absolutely perfect.</p>

<p>Our dinner at the Monks' was pleasant. I had Sir
Rivers Wilson next to me, and he is a charming neighbour,
has been everywhere, knows everybody, and talks
easily without any pose. There was a concert in the
evening&mdash;very good&mdash;Trebelli, Lloyd, Nordica, etc. I
made acquaintance with Nordica, who is an American,
Miss Norton, from Boston I think. She sings beautifully.
I said to her (they were all talking hard between
the songs), "What a noise! Can you ever begin?" "Oh,
certainly," she said, "I shall make much more noise than
they do," and she was quite right. Her voice rang
through the room. One of her songs was Delibes'
"Filles de Cadiz," which she sang splendidly.</p>

<p class="author">June 12th.</p>

<p>This afternoon we have been sight-seeing. Jean came
to breakfast, and we started off with Jusserand and St.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_277" title="pg 277"> </a>
Genys to see the Panorama of Niagara, which they say
is extremely well done. I wanted the foreigners to have
an idea of our great Falls, for I think in their hearts they
were rather disposed to agree with a statement in one of
the Swiss guide-books in speaking of the falls of the
Rhine at Schaffhausen, "generally supposed to surpass
the celebrated Falls of Niagara in America." However
they were agreeably disappointed and were much pleased
and interested. The Panorama is really very good. It
is so many years since I have seen Niagara that I had
forgotten how magnificent the Horse Shoe Fall is, and I
almost expected to hear the roar of the cataract, and to
see the little Indian boy selling moccasins and maple
sugar. I wonder if I would like maple sugar now. One
of my French friends, Mdme. Casimir Perier, to whom
I offered as a great treat some American home-made gingerbread,
could hardly swallow it, and assured me that
I couldn't eat it either if it had not been a "souvenir d'enfance."
On leaving Niagara we went to the Aquarium
to see a dog show. There were some fine specimens,
but I didn't think any of the fox terriers as good as my
Boniface. We also saw a swimming match, young ladies
disporting themselves in the water in most wonderful
costumes. Then to change our ideas we went into Westminster
Abbey, just getting there for the end of the afternoon
service. We heard the anthem, which was beautiful.
It is such a good choir&mdash;some of the boys' voices
divine, and they look like such little angels in their white
surplices. A good many people were waiting to go
round the Abbey at the end of the service, and we had
some difficulty in getting away from the various guides
who haunt the church and fall upon strangers. We
wandered about with Jusserand for our cicerone. He
knows everything about everything, and we had an interesting
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_278" title="pg 278"> </a>
hour. Some of the old tombs are so curious.
We got back to the Embassy for tea, having enjoyed ourselves
immensely. I think in her heart Jean was rather
shocked at the Aquarium performance&mdash;didn't think it
was exactly the place for me&mdash;that was the reason I liked
it, I suppose, I am so often now in the place where I
ought to be.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
June 12, 1888.</p>

<p>It is beautiful again to-day. We had a nice canter
in the Row. Everyone was talking about the German
Emperor, and speculating over the future. There is a
curious mistrust of the young Prince. No one seems
to know exactly what he will do, and what will be his
attitude toward England. This afternoon we have been
out to Chiswick with the Florians, and Francis, to
launch a torpilleur built for the French Navy by
Thornycroft. We found Thornycroft and some of his
friends waiting for us at the entrance of the dockyard.
They took us to a platform covered with red cloth erected
quite close to the boat&mdash;which was prettily dressed with
flags&mdash;the men said her shape was wonderful (for a torpilleur,
which never can be graceful). They gave me a
bottle of champagne, and told me what to do. I flung
the bottle as hard as I could against the stern of the boat,
saying "Success to the 'Coureur.'" It broke into a thousand
pieces, the champagne spattering all over my dress.
We then adjourned to a summer-house overlooking the
river for tea, and afterward went over the boat. There
are accommodations (such as they are) for two officers
and nine men, but it must be most uncomfortable, particularly
in rough weather. However, she was built for
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_279" title="pg 279"> </a>
speed, Thornycroft told us, and everything was suppressed
that was not absolutely necessary. I hope she
will make a good record.</p>

<p class="author">June 13th.</p>

<p>Yesterday I decided quite suddenly to go to Ascot. It
was a beautiful day, not too hot, and the Florians were
quite ready to go with me. W. hates races and a long
day in the country. We got down all right, hearing
vague rumours on the way about the Emperor's death,
but the Royal box was open, prepared evidently for the
Princes, and there were quantities of people on the lawn.
We were standing near the gate waiting to see the procession
appear, when suddenly Lord Coventry, Master
of the Buckhounds, rode in alone. Instantly everyone
said there must be bad news from the German Emperor
(which was true). The Prince of Wales had a telegram,
just as he was getting into his carriage, from the Queen,
to say the news was very bad, and none of them must go
to the races. Very soon some of the gentlemen of the
Prince's party arrived, among others Karolyi, who said
the Emperor was dying&mdash;dead probably at that moment.
The Prince's servants and lunch were sent back as soon
as possible (of course all their provisions and servants
had been sent to Ascot, as they have a big lunch party
there every day), so we all lunched with Lord Coventry.
I went up after lunch to the top of the stand to
see the race, and had the satisfaction of seeing the French
horse come in an <em>easy</em> last.</p>

<p>We went to tea with Lady Diana Huddleston, who has
a pretty cottage close to the course, and sat under the
trees some time. I had refused a dinner in London, and
was in no hurry to get back. We quite expected to see
the Emperor's death in the evening papers, but he seems
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_280" title="pg 280"> </a>
to have rallied again a little. Poor man, how terrible it
is the way he fights for his life&mdash;and he has known from
the first, they say, that there was no hope. I am so
sorry for her&mdash;she is so clever, so ambitious, and would
have done so much for Germany.</p>


<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Woburn Abbey</span>,<br >
June 15, 1888.</p>

<p>We arrived here yesterday for tea. It had rained
hard in the morning. W. and I were riding and were
taking our usual quick canter at the far end of the Park
(Marble Arch) when the storm began. We got home
as fast as we could, but were dripping, both of us. The
water poured off my hat like a shower-bath when I
took it off. We had just time to get dry and dress before
starting for the station where we found the Duke's
<sup><a href="#fn10" id="r10">[10]</a></sup>
r&eacute;gisseur waiting for us with a "wagon-salon." We
had a short railway journey through pretty English
village country; then a drive of half an hour brought
us here. The Park is enormous, fine trees and beautifully
green&mdash;such a rest after London smoke. The
house is very large, with a great square court and
corridors running all around it filled with family and
historical pictures. The Duchess and her daughters
were waiting for us in the morning room. We had
tea and almost immediately went upstairs, as it was
late. I have a charming big room with such views
over the Park. There are always in these large houses
lovely bits of old furniture, pictures, old china, etc.
The dinner was handsome&mdash;quantities of gold and silver
plate, and the table covered with azaleas. The Duke
talked a great deal. He speaks French and German like
a native (was brought up in Germany) and has the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_281" title="pg 281"> </a>
courteous, dignified manner of the old-fashioned English
gentleman&mdash;a little stiff perhaps (they say people, even
his children, are afraid of him), but I find him most attractive,
particularly in these days when people haven't
time apparently to be polite. The house party is small&mdash;Lord
Tavistock, son of the house, with his handsome
wife, Lady Ampthill, widow of Lord Ampthill (whom
you will remember well as Odo Russell in Rome, and who
was for years British Ambassador in Berlin). We saw
him there when we stopped three or four days on our
way to Moscow for the Coronation. They loved him in
Berlin, just as they did in Rome. Do you remember how
much put out all the women were there when his engagement
was announced? Lady Ampthill looks sad, and is
of course most anxious about the Emperor Frederick, and
eager for news, she knew him and the Empress so well
at Berlin. There is also B&ouml;hm, the sculptor, and one or
two young men. The evening was short, everyone
talking of course about the Emperor. The Duke says his
death will be an immense loss to the whole world. The
ladies came upstairs about 10.30&mdash;the men went to the
smoking-room. This morning it is showery&mdash;I didn't
go down to breakfast, but about 12.30 I found my way
to the drawing-room, and the Duchess showed me the
house before lunch. It would take weeks to see all that
is in it. The gallery that runs round the court is filled
with portraits of Russells of every degree, also various
Kings and Queens of England. There are splendid pictures
all over the house&mdash;one drawing-room absolutely
panelled with Canalettos. When we had been over the
house we went into the garden to dedicate a fountain
which B&ouml;hm had made, and also to see a full length
statue of the Duchess which he had also just completed
for the garden. I am very glad to know B&ouml;hm. He is
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_282" title="pg 282"> </a>
intelligent and sympathetic, original too. He and W.
had a long talk last night in the "fumoir," and it seems
he was much struck with W. and said afterward to the
Duke "Der weiss alles."</p>

<p>After lunch, just as we were starting to have tea at
Ampthill, we received two telegrams&mdash;one from the Embassy,
and one from Deichmann&mdash;telling of the Emperor's
death at 11 this morning&mdash;so that long struggle is
over. We drove over to Ampthill, and walked about in
the garden with umbrellas and waterproofs, but of course
the place looked triste and dark as there are great trees
close to the house. There was a very good picture of
Lord Ampthill in one of the drawing-rooms, and souvenirs
of their diplomatic life in every direction; signed
photographs of all sorts of distinguished people&mdash;snuff-boxes,
medals, etc.</p>

<p class="author">June 16th.</p>

<p>It is still grey and damp, but no rain. The Duchess
took us for a beautiful <em>grass</em> drive through miles of
rhododendrons, quite enchanting&mdash;I have never seen
anything like it;&mdash;but again the want of sunlight made
a great difference. The contrast between the deep green
of the lawn and the extraordinary amount and variety
of colour was most striking. We left about 3&mdash;immediately
after lunch. I had quite a talk with the Duke
while we were waiting for the carriage. He told me he
had been so pleased to have had W. at his house and to
hear him talk. He said&mdash;"I am not a Republican, but
I must say that so long as the Republic finds men like
him to serve her, there can be nothing better for France."</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, June 24th.</p>

<p>We all went to the funeral service for the Emperor
Frederick this morning, all of us smothered in cr&ecirc;pe with
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_283" title="pg 283"> </a>
long cr&ecirc;pe veils. It was precisely the same service over
again as we had had for the old Emperor a few months
ago. The heat was something awful&mdash;so many people&mdash;and
it was very long. I dined in the evening at Hurlingham
with Sir Roderick Cameron, and that was nice; deliciously
cool, lights all about the place, and the Hungarian
band playing.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
July 12, 1888.</p>

<p>Last night I had a novel and most amusing experience.
I went with Count and Countess de Florian (they are always
ready to do anything I want) to dine at the Mansion
House. W. could not go. As soon as we arrived they
roared out my name, or rather my official title&mdash;"Her Excellency
the French Ambassadress," and I walked alone
(the Florians a little behind) up the great hall lined with
people to where the Lord Mayor was standing, with his
robes, chains, etc., a mace-bearer on one side, and a sort
of trumpeter on the other. He stood quite still until I
got close to him, then shook hands and asked my permission
to remove his robes (ermine). We then went in
to dinner. The Lord Mayor and his wife sat side by
side, and I was on his right. The dinner was fairly good
(a regular banquet, 70 or 80 people), with music and
speeches. I rather like the ceremony of the "loving cup."
The cup was a handsome heavy gold tankard, with
handles and a cover, and was brought first to the Lord
Mayor. He rose&mdash;I did the same, and he asked me to
take off the cover, which I did, and held it while he drank.
Then he wiped the edge with his napkin, and passed it to
me. The man next to me got up and held the cover
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_284" title="pg 284"> </a>
while I drank. (The cup is very heavy and I had to
take it with both hands.) The same ceremony was repeated
all around the enormous table, and it was a pretty
and curious sight to see a couple always standing&mdash;the
women in full dress and jewels standing out well between
the black coats of the men. It seems it is a very
old custom, a remnant of rough feudal times, when the
man drinking was obliged to have a friend standing next
to him, to ward off a possible blow, his hands being occupied.
I don't know what we drank&mdash;I should think a
sort of hot spiced wine. Of course one just touches the
edge of the cup. A wonderful man, in old-fashioned
garb and a stentorian voice, stood always behind the Lord
Mayor's chair, and called out all the names, toasts, etc.
We went in afterward to Mrs. Oppenheim, who had a
musical party&mdash;all the pretty women, and Mme. Nordica
singing beautifully, with the orchestra of the Opera.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
July 14, 1888.</p>

<p>I am rather tired to-night, but I think you must hear
about the com&eacute;die while it is still fresh in my mind. It
really went very well. We arranged a sort of rampe
with flowers and ribbons (Th&eacute;nard's suggestion) at the
end of the ball-room, and made up the background with
screens, curtains, etc. The little troupe had been well
drilled by Th&eacute;nard, who took a great deal of trouble, not
only with their diction, but with their movements. At
first they were always standing in a heap and tumbling
over each other, or insisting upon turning their backs to
the audience. "Ce n'est pas bien joli, ce que vous montrez
au public, mes enfants," says Th&eacute;nard. Here is the
programme:&mdash;</p>

<p>I was very proud of my little troupe. B&eacute;atrice looked
very well and stately in powder, black satin, and lace.
Mile. de Langhe and Daisy very well got up, and the two
children charming. Lady Mary Pepys was too sweet,
and they danced their minuet perfectly. There were roars
of laughter when Francis appeared as "Ma&icirc;tre de
Danse" with a white wig and his violin. The children
were not at all shy, enjoyed themselves immensely. B.
was a little "&eacute;mue" at first when she saw how many
people there were, but it didn't last and she was excellent,
so perfectly correct, and unfrivolous, and boring.
Francis said his little poetry, "Le bon G&icirc;te" of D&eacute;roul&egrave;de,
quite prettily. W. was rather surprised and quite pleased,
and Th&eacute;nard beamed, as she had coached him. She recites
some of those "Chants du Soldat" of D&eacute;roul&egrave;de's
divinely. It is a perfect treat to hear her recite in her beautiful
rich voice "Le Petit Clairon," also "La Fianc&eacute;e du
Timbalier," with an accompaniment of soft music.</p>

<p>All the children (as we had invited Francis's young
friends to see the performance) had tea together afterward,
and they wound up with a dance. The men of the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_286" title="pg 286"> </a>
Embassy were much pleased, particularly Jusserand, who
is rather "difficile." They complimented B. very much;
said she spoke so distinctly and with very little accent. It
was rather trying for her to play before all the Embassy
and an ex-member of the Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise. Francis's
blue velvet coat and lace ruffles were very becoming to
him. Wolff told him how to hold his violin, I wish you
could have seen it. It was much prettier than the original
little play at Bourneville, when we executed as well
as we could a menuet.</p>

<p>We had a very select public, among others Wyndham
of the Criterion, who is an interesting man and a
charming actor. When you come over I will take you
to see his David Garrick, which I consider a perfect
bit of acting. I wrote and asked him to "assister aux
d&eacute;buts d'un jeune collaborateur." The funny formal
old-fashioned Berquin phrases amused him. He knows
French well.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, August.</p>

<p>We have decided to go to Scotland with Sir Roderick
Cameron and his family, and are starting in a day or
two. London is dull and empty, has suddenly become
a deserted city. Even the shops are empty, and the
Park a wilderness. All our colleagues have gone. I
think W. is the only Ambassador in London, and he
wants to get off to France and have a few days on the
Aisne before he goes to the Conseil G&eacute;n&eacute;ral. We means
Francis and me for Scotland.</p>

August 17, 1888.</p>

<p>I will try and give you an account of our journey, Dear.
We arrived in this most lovely place for late dinner yesterday,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_287" title="pg 287"> </a>
and went almost at once to bed, having begun our
day at 7 o'clock. We left London Tuesday morning by
the Flying Scotchman, and a tremendous pace we came.
There were quantities of people at the station, all going
apparently by our train&mdash;children, dogs, guns, fishing
rods, provision baskets, tall footmen racing after distracted
French maids, and piles of luggage. We had our
saloon carriage reserved (as we were a fair party&mdash;C.,
the four girls, Duncan, a friend Miss W., Francis and
I and two or three maids). We had also a fair amount
of baskets, shawls, cushions, etc. It was a lovely morning,
not too warm, and I think W., who came down to
the station to see us off, was half sorry he was not
going too.</p>

<p>We stopped for luncheon at York, and got to Edinburgh
at 6.30. The pace was frightful, but we went so
smoothly that one hardly realised the speed. We went
straight to the hotel to see our rooms and order dinner,
and then went out for a walk. The streets were
crowded; omnibuses and cabs with luggage in every direction.
The old town and castle looked most picturesque
in the soft summer light. Daisy and I went out
again after dinner, and after loitering a little near the
hotel we saw a tramcar, asked where it went, and
mounted on the top, telling the man we would go as far
as we could, and then come back. It was a beautiful
moonlight night, and we were very cool and comfortable
perched on the top of the car. When the man came to
get the money for the places I discovered that I had no
change&mdash;merely a sovereign. The old gentleman, a tall,
white-bearded Scotchman, grumbled a good deal, and
made various uncomplimentary remarks to himself in a
low tone. However after some little time he appeared
with a handful of silver. I took the money mechanically
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_288" title="pg 288"> </a>
and began to stuff it into my portemonnaie, as he looked
at me severely and said&mdash;"First count your money to see
that it is right, and then give me what you owe for your
places."</p>

<p>We were up early the next morning&mdash;breakfasted at 9
o'clock as we wanted to see a little of Edinburgh before
starting for Oban at 12 o'clock. It was an enchanting
morning, not too warm, and we went first to the Castle.
There is not much to see inside&mdash;always a beautiful view
of sea and hills. There is a chapel and some old rooms
which various Kings and Queens of Scotland have inhabited
at various times. A company of Highlanders in
Cameron plaids were being exercised in the courtyard,
and a fine stalwart set of men they were.</p>

<p>From there we drove through some of the old streets
(Cannongate, etc.) to Holyrood, which was most interesting.
The children of course were most anxious to see
the spot where Rizzio was murdered, and the blood-stains
on the floor, but they have disappeared years ago. We
were delighted with the pictures. There are quantities
of course of Mary, Queen of Scots&mdash;one large portrait
with that beautiful, sad Stuart face&mdash;as if they all foresaw
their destinies. I had forgotten how small and low
the rooms are. In these luxurious days no ordinary lady
would be satisfied with Queen Mary's bedroom and boudoir;
and the servants, accustomed to be quite as comfortable
as their masters, would give warning at once.
We drove straight from the Palace to the station, where
our carriage was waiting for us. All our wraps,
cushions, etc., neatly arranged; and started for Oban,
a most lovely journey, particularly all about Loch Awe.
We got to Oban about 7, and I shall often think of that
lovely evening. The harbour filled with yachts and sail-boats
of all kinds&mdash;the water blue and dancing, and the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_289" title="pg 289"> </a>g
most divine soft pink lights on the hills, a little like what
we used to love at Capri and Ischia&mdash;quite beautiful.
Daisy and I did some shopping before dinner&mdash;bought
clean collars for the children, who were decidedly the
worse for the two days' journey, and we also interviewed
the well-known Ewan at the tartan shop with a view
to kilted skirts. D. found their tartan at once of course
as there are so many Camerons&mdash;ours was rather more
difficult as there are few <em>Chisholms</em> left (my Mother-in-law
was born Chisholm) and the authorities in London
told us we could certainly wear the family plaid. The
shop people promised to get it for me. The man was
much interested in the skirt for Miss W. Being an
American there was no family tartan to be looked up, and
she couldn't quite make up her mind. However he came
to the rescue, telling her that "all the <em>American</em> ladies
take the Royal Stuart, Miss." We had an excellent dinner
at the very small hotel where we were obliged to go&mdash;all
the swell hotels were full&mdash;and there are quantities of
people in the streets, and boats coming and going from
the yachts. The Englishwomen all look so nice in their
yachting dresses, almost all of dark blue serge and a sailor
hat or regular yachting cap. The cap is rather trying,
but the young and pretty women look charming in it.
Some of the trippers and their ladies are wonderful to behold.
We stood near a couple who were just starting
for Skye on one of the steamers. The man was in a
wonderful checked suit, and the lady in a brilliant red and
green tartan (not unlike the Chisholm), on her head was
a Scotch stalking cap, which was not becoming to a red,
round face. However <em>she</em> was satisfied and so was her
companion, who looked at her most admiringly, saying&mdash;"I
say, you are fetching in that cap." "Il y en a pour
tous les go&ucirc;ts." When we got back to the hotel we
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_290" title="pg 290"> </a>
found that Sir R. had quite changed our "itin&eacute;raire."
He had seen the boat, a fine large one which made the
outside passage to Arishaig, so instead of taking the
Caledonian Canal and landing at Fort William where
carriages and carts were ordered for us, he decided that
we should go by sea, and take our chance of finding some
means of transport. He did, however, send a telegram
to Arishaig, as the hotel man told him he would never
find any conveyance for such a large party.</p>

<p>We started at 9 o'clock, and the sail was enchanting.
About 12 we ran rather close to a small headland, and
the Captain told us we had arrived. Apparently we
were in broad Atlantic with a rocky shore in the distance&mdash;however
a boat appeared, one of those broad, flat boats
which one sees all over in Scotland. Our disembarkation
was difficult as we were 11 people with quantities of
trunks and parcels. Happily the sea was quite smooth.
All the passengers were wildly interested in the operation
and crowded to the side of the steamer. When all
the party had finally got off with trunks, bags, a bird in
a cage, and a kitten in a basket, one of the passengers remarked&mdash;"They
only need a pony in that boat, to make
the party complete."</p>

<p>To say we found a landing-place would be absolute
fiction. As we neared the shore we saw a quantity of
black, slippery rocks, and on these we landed, the boatmen
holding the boat as near as they could, and we climbing,
and slipping, and struggling to get on shore. Our
baggage was dumped on the rocks and there we were&mdash;not
a habitation or a creature in sight. At last we found
a sort of house behind a mass of rocks, and saw several
carriages in the distance which we supposed were for us.
Not at all! Sir R.'s telegram had not been received and
those were carriages waiting for a "Corps" which was
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_291" title="pg 291"> </a>
being conveyed across on a yacht. We tried to persuade
them to take some of us at any rate, and at last with great
difficulty one carriage was given to us. The negotiations
were extremely difficult, as nobody spoke anything
but Gaelic, except an old woman, and she was so cross
and apparently so suspicious of the whole party that we
got on better by signs and a few extra shillings. Sir R.
and the maids walked (4 miles through lovely country)
and we all finally arrived at the little fishing village of
Arishaig, where there is a good inn. It is a little place,
three or four fishermen's cottages, a post-office, and two
churches, a large Roman Catholic Cathedral and a small
Established Church. We had a good lunch and
started at 3.30, getting here at 5.30. Such a beautiful
drive&mdash;all blue sky, and heather almost as blue&mdash;and great
grey mountains. We walked up two very steep hills, but
had such glorious views at the top that we didn't mind the
climb.</p>

<p>This place is charming&mdash;the house fairly large. It
stands low on the lake or arm of the sea, and has pine
woods and high mountains behind. It is absolutely lonely&mdash;no
houses near, except one or two (agent's and farmer's)
that belong to the estate. The country is lovely,
wild and picturesque, but it would be a terrible place to
be in except with a large party. There is nothing nearer
than 10 miles, and no real village or settlement for 25.
We are about half way between Fort William and Arishaig
(each 20 or 25 miles away). I think all our provisions
come from Fort William. A stage passes twice
a day, morning and evening. Our baggage arrived at
10.30, and we were all glad to go to bed, as we had begun
our day early. It is so still to-night&mdash;I am writing
in my room&mdash;the lake looks beautiful in the moonlight,
and there is not a sound.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_292" title="pg 292"> </a></p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Inveraylort</span>,<br >
Sunday, August 19th.</p>

<p>We have settled down most comfortably in the house,
which is fairly large, but we are never indoors except to
eat and sleep. We had a lovely drive yesterday all
through this property, and to a neighbour's where there is
a pillar to show where Prince Charlie landed. There are
many Roman Catholics in these parts, which accounts for
the large church in the little fishing village of Arishaig.</p>

<p>This morning we had a service in the "Wash-house"&mdash;a
red-headed Scotch peasant was the "Minister." It
was a curious sort of independent service, impromptu
prayers, and a long sermon. The congregation consisted
of ourselves and the household. Miss Cameron, the
owner of this place, who is staying at her agent's cottage
on the place, some friends of hers, and the people of the
little inn where the daily coach from Fort William stops
for rest and luncheon. There are no other habitations of
any kind except a few crofters' cottages across the lake.
After luncheon we went for a long walk along the stream
where there are plenty of fish, and came home over the
hills. They are blue and deep purple, with heather, and
there are divine views in every direction.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, August 22d.</p>

<p>It is again a beautiful day. We intended to row down
to see some friends of Sir R.'s about 5 or 6 miles off
at the mouth of the lake, where it runs into the sea,
but there is some trouble about the boats. Our "propri&eacute;taire,"
Miss C., seems to have singular ideas as to the
respective rights of owners and tenants. It was so fine
and cool that we decided to walk, and the B.'s promised
to send us back in their boat. It was long, but the path
was not too steep all along the lake, and we arrived not
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_293" title="pg 293"> </a>
too exhausted. They gave us tea, showed us the house
and garden, and we started back about 9. The row home
was enchanting, but weird&mdash;not a thing to be seen of any
kind, except seals, which came up close to the boat. I
had never seen one near, and thought at first they were
dogs and was so surprised to see so many swimming
about; not a sound except the splash of our oars in the
water when we turned our backs to the sea, the heather-covered
mountains shutting us in on all sides. It was
quite wild and beautiful, but a solitude that would be
appalling if one lived altogether in the country.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Inveraylort</span>, August 27th.</p>

<p>After all they are not going to stay the month, Sir R.
and his proprietor can't come to terms, and I think they
will probably take a yacht and cruise about a little. The
lake is decidedly rough this morning, but still we thought
we must row across to some crofters' cottages. They
told us they were of the poorest description, and we
wanted to see what their life and houses were. Most
wretched little houses (our horses much better off in their
stables), generally one room, sometimes two; no floor,
merely the earth trodden hard, and covered with straw.
To-day it had been raining; there were puddles in the
corners and the straw was decidedly damp. A peat fire
was burning, and the only opening (no window) was
a hole in the thatched roof, which lets the smoke out
and the rain in. An old woman was spinning and an
old man was sitting in the corner mending a fishing net.
They were tall, gaunt figures&mdash;might be any age. They
spoke nothing but Gaelic, but soon a young woman appeared
on the scene who knew English. She looked as
old as her mother, but had a keen, sharp face. I was
rather interested in the spinning-wheel, so the two
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_294" title="pg 294"> </a>
women suggested that I should try; but I could do
nothing. Either I went too fast and broke the yarn,
or else the wheel remained absolutely motionless. I
bought some yarn, as I had broken various bits, and
then we started home, carrying away an impression of
wretched poverty and hard lives of toil, with little to
lighten the burden.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Oban</span>, August 29th.</p>

<p>We are back here after a most eventful journey from
Inveraylort. We started in the rain, the mist closing
round us and blotting out the whole landscape. We had
two carriages, but the pony cart came to grief, and the
two girls and Francis were thrown out. Miss W. had
an ugly cut on her face, but poor N. was lying on the
ground, pale and suffering, convinced that her arm was
broken. When we got up to them we took her into the
waggonette and got on as quickly as we could to Caupar,
our destination, where we had been told of a wonderful
bone-setter who was well known in all these parts. He
saw at once what was wrong&mdash;her shoulder was dislocated,
and said she must not continue the journey, so
we left her there with her sister and brother, and we
came on here. They all appeared this afternoon&mdash;N.
with her arm in a sling and looking fairly well. She
said the man set it so quickly and gently she hardly had
time to feel any pain.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Oban</span>,<br >
September 3d.</p>

<p>We had a beautiful day yesterday for our excursion
to Staffa and Iona. The sea was perfectly calm, and
the lights and shades on the mountains enchanting. It
was a lovely sail; sometimes we ran into little shaded
harbours with two or three cottages and a hotel perched
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_295" title="pg 295"> </a>
high up on the top of a mountain, and sometimes passed
so close to land under the great cliffs that one could
throw a stone on the shore. The islands are most interesting,
with their old churches and their curious stone
crosses, and there were not too many people on the boat.
The return was delicious as we sat on deck, watching all
the colours fade away from sea and hills.</p>

<p>We leave to-morrow for London and Paris, and I am
very sorry to go. We have enjoyed our three weeks
immensely. The country is so beautiful, and then it was
a great pleasure to be with some of my own people; we
have been away so long that the family ties get weaker.
Francis was quite happy with some cousins to run about
with.</p>

<p>I got back from Paris last night, rather sorry to come.
The weather was enchanting, warm and bright, and, of
course, quantities of people for the Exhibition. It isn't
half ready yet, but is most interesting&mdash;so much to see.
I dined and breakfasted there several times at the various
restaurants&mdash;one evening with the Walter Burns and
a party, and we went afterward to see the "fontaines
lumineuses," which are really fairy-like; but such a
crowd. I also heard the two American prima donnas&mdash;Miss
Eames, who is very handsome, has a fresh,
young voice, and is an ideal Juliette. She is a vision
really in her bridal dress as Juliette. Miss Sanderson
is also very handsome, but in quite a different style.
Her voice is very high and true; she was singing "Esclarmonde"
at the Op&eacute;ra Comique. Massenet has taught
her everything. I have found quantities of invitations
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_296" title="pg 296"> </a>
here, in fact was obliged to come over, as we have a big
dinner the day after to-morrow, and the Court ball.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, May 28, 1889.</p>

<p>We had our first encounter with Boulanger this morning.
W. and I were walking our horses down the Row
when we met three gentlemen cantering toward us. As
they passed we heard they were speaking French, but
didn't pay any particular attention. I merely said, "I
wonder who those men are," one so rarely hears French
spoken in the Row. A few minutes later we met Lord
Charles Beresford, who took a little turn with us, and
said to W., "The other distinguished Frenchman is also
in the Row,"&mdash;then we divined. A few moments afterward
(the Row is so small one crosses people all the
time) we met them again, Boulanger in the middle riding
his famous black horse&mdash;a man on each side riding
good horses, chestnuts. They all wore top-hats, which no
Englishmen do now in the morning. The men all wear
low hats, the women also, and covert coats, the girls
cotton blouses; not at all the correct style we used to
admire as children in <em>Punch</em> when those beautiful women
of Leech's riding in the Park filled our childish hearts
with envy. I was rather curious as to what would happen,
as W. knows Boulanger slightly, and went to him
when he was Minister of War about something concerning
the military attach&eacute;; however, there was no difficulty,
as Boulanger was apparently too engrossed in
conversation with his companions to notice anyone. I
wonder if we shall meet him anywhere? They tell us
that some of the society people mean to invite him, but I
suppose they will scarcely ask us together.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, May 30th.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the last Drawing-room of this season.
I rather feel as if it were my last in London, but one
never knows. We (Corps Diplomatique) were still all
in black, the English in colours. It was long and tiring.
We dined at Lord Sudeley's&mdash;I rather wishing I had no
engagement. I am always tired after those hours of
standing, and the diadem is heavy, and the train, too,
held over one's arm; however, I was quite repaid, as I
had a charming neighbour. I didn't know at all who
he was, as they rarely introduce in England, so we embarked
on one of those banal, inane conversations one
has with a stranger of whom one knows nothing, and
were talking on smoothly about nothing at all, when he
remarked, casually, "I suppose you never go to church."
This I at once resented vehemently, so he explained that
he didn't know, as I was a Frenchwoman, probably a
Catholic (as if they didn't go to church), etc. He
turned out to be Canon Rogers, a charming, intelligent,
well-known man, most independent in his words and
actions. He is rector of St. Botolph's, a church in
Bishopsgate, the most disreputable part of London. We
became great friends, and he asked me if I would go
and lunch with him one Sunday, and he would show me
Petticoat Lane. I agreed of course, and we decided for
next Sunday. He said he had never had a French lady
and an Ambassadress as a guest, and didn't quite know
what to do. Should he ask the Prince of Wales and
order champagne? I told him my tastes were very
simple, and if I might bring my cousin Hilda, and one
of the Secretaries, I should be quite happy&mdash;also I liked
apple-pie, which he says his cook makes very well. I
haven't had such a pleasant dinner for a long time.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_298" title="pg 298"> </a></p>

<p class="author">Monday, June 3d.</p>

<p>We made our expedition to Bishopsgate yesterday,
and most interesting it was. I went with Hilda and M.
Lecomte, one of the secretaries, who knows English, and
is very keen to see anything a little out of the way. We
had a long drive to the church through the city, and
arrived only to hear the end of Canon Rogers' sermon,
which was strong and practical. As soon as the service
was over we went down to the door and found him and
his curate waiting for us. The first thing he did was
to send away my carriage, which had already attracted
much attention with the tall footman, velvet breeches,
cockades, etc. He said he would never venture into
Petticoat Lane in such an equipage, and would we please
share his modest conveyance; so Hilda and I got into
his victoria, and Lecomte and the curate walked close
to the carriage behind. We had two policemen in front,
two behind, and a detective. I rather demurred to such
a display of municipal strength on my account, but he
said it was necessary, he much preferred having them,
he was afraid people would crowd around us and insist
upon my buying something. The street was narrow,
crowded with people, as there was also a fair going on
and everything imaginable being sold (it is the one place
in London where you can buy <em>one</em> shoe or <em>one</em> stocking!).
The people were almost all Jews, and I must say they
were a bad-looking lot, frightfully rough specimens.
Some of the women, girls too, with such sullen, scowling
faces. We went at a foot's pace (the only carriage),
and hadn't the slightest difficulty in making our way.
Everyone knew Mr. Rogers and spoke to him&mdash;"Good
morning, Governor," "God bless you, Sir." Two or
three children ran up to him, one a pretty little dark-eyed
girl breathless to tell him she was in church, though she
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_299" title="pg 299"> </a>
came late. He was so nice to them all, called them all by
name, patted the children on the head, and exhorted some
of the women to keep their husbands out of the drinking
shops, and to wash their children's faces. They say he
does an immense amount of good down there, but it must
be uphill work. I have rarely seen such a forbidding
looking set of people. Some of the women came up
rather close to the low victoria and made comments on
our garments. (We had dressed very simply at his
request. I wore my blue foulard and a blue straw bonnet
with iris on it. Hilda was in light grey with a black hat.)
"You have got a beautiful bonnet, my lady. Oh, look at
her umbrell!" The "umbrell" excited much attention. I
couldn't think why at first, as it was also rather dark and
plain; when I remembered that it had a watch in the
handle upon which, of course, all eyes were fixed. I
think the detective kept his eye upon it too, as he came
up rather close on my side. The detective took Lecomte
to a famous jeweller's shop near in Whitechapel, where
there had been a murder some days ago. We drove all
through the fair surrounded by these villainous faces
(here and there a pretty, fair, innocent, childish face) and
I wasn't sorry to get back to civilisation and the rectory,
though I am very glad to have seen it. The rectory is a
large old-fashioned house in Devonshire Square, shut in
with high houses and high trees, and never, I should
think, could a ray of sunshine get anywhere near it.
One felt miles away from London and life of any kind.
It was a curious contrast to the turbulent, noisy, seething
crowd we had just left. We had a charming breakfast,
Mr. Rogers talking all the time delightfully, so
original and so earnest, convinced that everyone in their
small circle could do so much to help, not only the poor
but the really bad, if only by example and a little sympathy;
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_300" title="pg 300"> </a>
he says no one ever helps the bad ones, only the
deserving poor get looked after.</p>

<p>About 3.30 we started again to see the People's Palace,
which he takes great interest in, and hopes he may
succeed in keeping the men away from the drinking
shops in the evening. It looked comfortable and practical,
the reading-room particularly, which is large and
airy, with all sorts of morning and evening papers (some
foreign ones), illustrated papers, and good, standard
books. The librarian told me that Walter Scott was
always asked for, also some American books, particularly
Indian stories, and travels of all kinds. I was
rather interested in hearing that, as whenever W. gives
books to a school library, or prizes in France, Walter
Scott or Fenimore Cooper are still the favourites (translated,
of course. I read the "Last of the Mohicans"
in French, and it was very well done). There were not
many people, but Mr. Rogers says on a fine, warm Sunday
they all prefer to be in the open air. There is also
a large swimming bath, given by Lord Rosebery. We
parted from our host at the door, having had a delightful
afternoon. It is a long time since I have heard anyone
talk who interested me so much.</p>

<p>The drive home along the Embankment was nice&mdash;quantities
of people out, quite like a Sunday in France.
We dined quietly at home. W. was much interested in
my day. I think if he had known exactly where I was
going, and that an escort of police was necessary, he
wouldn't have agreed to the expedition.</p>

<p>The Court Ball was brilliant last night. The Prince
opened the ball with Princess Louise, and the Princess
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_301" title="pg 301"> </a>
with Lord Fife. The engagement of Princess Louise of
Wales to Lord Fife is just announced, and has of course
created quite a sensation. Of course there are two currents
of opinion&mdash;the old-fashioned people are rather
shocked at the idea of a Royal Princess marrying a subject;
but I fancy the entourage of the Prince and Princess
of Wales are pleased,&mdash;and Fife is a general favourite.
It is not very easy for the English princesses to
marry. They <em>must</em> marry Protestants, and there are not
many Protestant princes who are not near relations.</p>

<p>I talked a little to the Shah, but I didn't find that very
amusing. He knows very little English or French, and
has a most disagreeable way of looking hard at one. He
planted himself directly in front of me, very close, and
said "he thought he had seen me before," which of course
he had, in Paris.</p>

<p>It seems that one of the Princesses pointed out to him,
in the supper-room, a lady neither very young nor very
beautiful, who was covered with splendid jewels, thinking
they might interest him. He stopped short in front
of her&mdash;then turned his back at once, saying "monstre."
They say he finds no woman handsome who has passed
twenty.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, July 2d.</p>

<p>It was a splendid summer day yesterday, ideal, for the
Shah's arrival by water. We drove down to the Speaker's
to see him come. The streets were lined with troops,
and there were quantities of people about. They let us
drive through the Mall and to Westminster between the
lines of soldiers (all the traffic was stopped). Almost
all the houses and balconies on the way were draped with
red, and crowded with women in their light, gay summer
dresses. There were a good many people at the
Speaker's, who gave us some tea and strawberries. The
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_302" title="pg 302"> </a>
Royal Barge arrived very punctually. It was not very
beautiful&mdash;an ordinary river steamer, painted light grey,
with gold lines, and fitted up with palms, red cushions,
and carpets, etc. The Thames was a pretty sight, such
quantities of boats of all kinds. We saw everything
quite well. There was a fair procession of state carriages,
and an escort of Life Guards; but what a barbarian the
Shah looks, with his embroidered coat and his big jewels,
and his coarse, bad face&mdash;however he was smiling,
and seemed pleased with his reception.</p>

<p>We waited to let the crowd disperse a little, and then
came home the same way through Constitution Hill. We
met the Prince and Princess coming back from Buckingham
Palace. Both looked very well&mdash;he in uniform, and
she in white, extraordinarily young in face and figure.
The two princes, Eddy and George, were with them, and
they were much applauded as they passed. In the evening
we had a musical party at Blumenthal's. The garden
was lighted and everyone sitting outside. The party was
in honour of Princess Louise, and the music very good,
as it always is there. Mdme. Grondal, a Swedish woman,
played beautifully, and Plunkett Greene sang very well.
He always brings down the house with "I'm Off to Philadelphy
in the Morning." Lord Lorne took me to supper.
I always like to talk to him. He was not much impressed
with his Persian Majesty either&mdash;thought the
days of Eastern potentates were over. I asked him what
he had come for, and why the English were so civil to
him; to which he replied, "Oh, I suppose some of the
swells want concessions, or railways."</p>

<p class="author">Monday, July 8, 1889.</p>

<p>We went to Hatfield this morning, where there was a
luncheon party for the Shah. It was decidedly grey and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_303" title="pg 303"> </a>
uncertain, in fact, raining a little when we started, and
I looked once or twice at my cr&egrave;me linon trimmed with
Valenciennes&mdash;but as I had ordered it especially for that
occasion, I decided to wear it. I put on a long cloak for
the train. The Hatfield parties are always very well arranged&mdash;trains
starting every ten minutes. It is hardly
three-quarters of an hour from London. There were
lots of people, and the short trajet passed quickly enough.
All the women were looking at each other to see the
dresses, as the weather was really bad. At Hatfield, one
of Lord Salisbury's sons was at the station to receive the
swells. I got separated in the crowd from W., so Lord
Edward put me into a brougham, and asked me if I
would take another Ambassador, as mine was missing
for the moment. I agreed, of course, so Comte Hatzfeldt
came with me. There was a large party staying in
the house, including the Prince and Princess, the Shah,
and various members of the family and Court. Lady
Salisbury was standing at one of the big doors opening
on the terrace. Lord Salisbury, she told me, was taking
the Shah for a drive in the park. We all loitered about a
little on the terrace. The rain had stopped and, though
there was no sun, the house looked beautiful with its grey
walls and splendid lines. The first person I saw was the
Duc d'Aumale, and we had quite a talk while waiting for
luncheon. The Prince also came out and talked. Luncheon
was served at small, round tables in the great dining-room.
As Doyens we were at the Royal table. The
Prince took me, and I had next to me the Grand Vizier,
who had taken in Lady Londonderry. She is very handsome,
very well dressed, and the Grand Vizier enjoyed
himself very much. It seems he is a very difficult gentleman,
and at some man's house party, Ferdinand Rothschild's,
I think, he was not pleased with his reception,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_304" title="pg 304"> </a>
or his place at the table, and declined to come downstairs.
There were about 70 people at luncheon, and as many
more, they told me, upstairs. Quantities of flowers, silver,
servants, etc., and a band playing. After breakfast
we all adjourned to the terrace and some photographic
groups were taken. There was some wonderful shooting
by some Americans which interested the Persians very
much, and one of the Shah's suite was most anxious to
try his hand at it, and forcibly took a rifle from the
American, who protested vigorously, but the Persian
kept hold of his gun and evidently meant to shoot, so
the American appealed directly to the Prince, saying
there would be an accident if he was allowed to go on;
and the Prince interfered and persuaded the irate Oriental
to give up his weapon.</p>

<p>They had asked a great many people to tea, but evidently
the rain had kept many away. The toilettes were
most varied&mdash;every description of costume, from the
Duchess of Rutland in white satin and diamonds (large
stones sewed all over the body of her dress) to the
simplest description of blue serge, covert coat, and even
a waterproof carried over one's arm. I was thinking of
going to get a cup of tea, when I crossed again the Duc
d'Aumale, who was also looking for the tea-table, so we
went off together and had a pleasant "quart d'heure."
He is always so nice to W. and me, and is so distinguished-looking
wherever he is&mdash;such extraordinary
charm of manner and so soldierly. He had been much
amused by the stories he had heard of the eccentricities
of the Persian suite. One of the ladies staying in the
house found two gentlemen sitting on her bed when she
went up to dress for dinner. I must say I think it was
awfully good of Lady Salisbury to ask them all to stay.</p>

<p>Princess Louise of Wales and Fife were married this
morning in the small chapel at Buckingham Palace.
Very few people were asked, no diplomats except Falbe,
Danish Minister, who is a great favourite at Court, and
asked always. The streets, especially Piccadilly, were
crowded with people. We had to go round by Belgrave
Square and Buckingham Palace to get to Marlborough
House. We were invited at 2 o'clock to see the bride
and the presents. The wedding party drove up just as
we arrived. Fife's coach, dark green with green and gold
liveries, was very handsome. The Princess of Wales
looked radiant, and the bride charming&mdash;beautifully
dressed and just pale enough to be interesting. The
King of Greece and Crown Prince of Denmark were both
there. The presents were beautiful&mdash;every imaginable
thing in diamonds and silver. The Prince and Princess's
tiara very handsome&mdash;also Fife's. There was a buffet
and tea in the garden, also in the drawing-rooms; and
we waited to see the young couple start. They looked
very happy and smiling. Their carriage was very handsome,
with four black horses and an outrider. Everyone
cheered and threw rice after them. They started
with a Royal escort, but at the top of the park Fife sent
it back, and they made their entry into Sheen in his carriage
only. They said he made a condition that there
should be no lady-in-waiting, that his wife should be
Duchess of Fife only; but of course she can never lose
her rank. None but Ambassadors were asked to the reception
at Marlborough House&mdash;no other diplomats.</p>

<p class="author">July 30th.</p>

<p>We had our last dinner this season&mdash;musical and all
Italians, Tosti, Vinci, and Picolellis. Mme. de Florian
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_306" title="pg 306"> </a>
came in late with her dinner guests, among others the
Duchesse de Richelieu, who is very fond of music. Tosti
is delightful once he gets to the piano, sings (with no
voice) and plays whatever one wants&mdash;his own music,
anybody's, and always so simply. It was very warm.
We all sat and stood on the balcony when we were not
playing and singing.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Hatfield</span>, January 8, 1891.</p>

<p>We came down last night for dinner. It was very
cold, snow and ice in London, and skating everywhere.
We are not a very large party&mdash;the family, some of Lord
Salisbury's secretaries, Casa Laiglesia (just made Ambassador&mdash;very
happy. Spain had only a <em>Minister</em> here
till now), the Duke and Duchess of Newcastle, etc. After
dinner the older members of the party played whist, and
the young ones danced in the great hall. This time we
have King James I.'s rooms, an enormous bed (with a
Royal crown on the top) where he really slept. We
have been out all day; the gentlemen went off early to
shoot, and I got down about 12. I found some of the
young women, Ladies Cranborne and Northcote, in the
hall and we decided we would go and skate. It was bitterly
cold, but no wind, and the pond is not far, just at
the end of the terrace. There was a little wooden house
on the edge where we put on our skates, and plenty of
chairs and canes. Ladies Northcote and Gwendoline
Cecil skate very well. Lady Salisbury came down to the
pond, took a broom from one of the numerous sweepers,
and swept hard to keep herself warm. After lunch I
went for a sleigh ride with Lady Salisbury in a pretty
little one-horse sleigh she had bought at the Exhibition.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_307" title="pg 307"> </a>
It was very good going in the park, but we bumped occasionally
going across the fields. To-night we broke up
rather early; we were all tired with the first day's skating,
and the men with their shooting.</p>

<p class="author">Friday.</p>

<p>It has been again a beautiful winter's day, and we have
skated all the afternoon until dark. Lady Salisbury came
again with her broom and swept vigorously. It seems
many doctors recommend sweeping now for women who
need exercise and cannot ride or walk. We tried hard
to make Casa Laiglesia come down to the pond, but he
refused absolutely&mdash;that was not at all his idea of pleasure.
We spent some time in the library looking over
some of the old manuscripts of the time of Queen Elizabeth
and King Philip of Spain, and we saw him taking
a short, very short turn on the terrace in the sun,
wrapped up so as to be almost "m&eacute;connaissable."</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, January 18th.</p>

<p>It is still very cold&mdash;the Serpentine is quite frozen,
and quantities of people skating. The ice is very bad,
rather like a ploughed field, but it is amusing to see all
the people. We have been this afternoon to Wimbledon,
and there it was delightful. There was quite a large
part reserved and beautifully smooth, belonging to a
club; so Comte de St. Genys (one of the secretaries),
who was with us, sent in his card, saying he was there
with the French Ambassadress; and they were most
civil, brought us chairs, and begged us to come back
whenever we liked. We saw some beautiful fancy skating,
both men and women. We skated afterward a little
on the big lake to see the people. It was a beautiful
day, and a very pretty sight, quite like a Dutch picture.</p>

<p>I was interrupted by a visit from Mr. Bryce. He
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_308" title="pg 308"> </a>
came really to ask about you and to know if you would
stay on at Alassio. He spoke so warmly and admiringly
of Schuyler that it was a pleasure to hear him. He said
he was certainly the cleverest, most cultivated American
he had ever seen, that he had never met anyone who
knew so many things well. He couldn't conceive how
any Government that had such a man to place could have
let any party feeling prevent them from giving him a
prominent place, in their own interest.</p>

Thursday, February 19th.</p>

<p>We have had a funny day. There was a sale of horses,
hunters principally, at Cricklewood, a place just outside
of London, where they have very good horses. We have
been there several times with Deichmann, who has always
fine horses, and have bought two or three ourselves.
I am looking for a saddle horse, so W. and I drove out
the other day, and I tried two which I liked very much
(there is a riding-school where one can try). Then
Newman, the head man, rode them over some hurdles
to show me how well they jumped. They promised to
let us know when the sale would be, and yesterday sent
word we must come to-day. I drove out with Hilda in
her pony carriage. We drew up close to the ring and
the auctioneer's stand and saw everything well. Her
horses were taken out and we made ourselves as comfortable
as we could with furs and couvertures. It was
bitterly cold, with a high wind that cut one in two. W.
and Deichmann wandered about in the crowd. The collection
of people was most amazing, horsey to a degree;
horse dealers, trainers, jockeys, racing men and women&mdash;a
few gentlemen here and there, not many. There
was a champagne lunch going on at Newman's, but that
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_309" title="pg 309"> </a>
we declined&mdash;so they brought us tea and excellent bread
and butter to the carriage. The two horses I had tried
were among the first and I hoped I should get one of
them, but they brought much more than the dealers supposed
they would. They looked extremely well when
they were brought out first, galloped over the grass, and
then jumping their hurdles beautifully, taking them easily
in a long stride (of course they were beautifully handled,
every point made the most of). W. made various
bids, but when it got beyond a certain sum he wouldn't
give any more, as it was a fancy price and could have
gone up indefinitely. I was rather disappointed, as I had
set my heart on the black horse. It was cold driving
home in the teeth of the wind. We dined with the Deichmanns,
with some of our colleagues, and everyone was
discussing the Empress Frederick's visit to Versailles.
Until then everything had gone most swimmingly, but
of course all French people were "froiss&eacute;s" at that. I
don't exactly understand her going. She is so intelligent,
and had apparently realised quite well how difficult
it would be for her ever to go to Paris. Years ago
in Rome, where we met her almost every night, she told
us she was so anxious to go to Paris, but she was afraid
she could not manage it. She wanted very much to meet
Renan&mdash;admired his books so much, and his great intelligence;
and I think she would have been delighted with
him. He was a charming talker on every subject, and
so easy.</p>

<p>We had an awful storm yesterday, a regular blizzard,
and a terrible night in the Channel. One of the good
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_310" title="pg 310"> </a>
boats, the Victoria, was out all night, not daring to land
at either Dover or Calais. One of our young attach&eacute;s
was on board, bringing over despatches, and they say he
looked green when he finally did arrive. The trains were
snowed up everywhere, even between Folkestone and
London, and the passengers nearly frozen and starved.
It seems incredible in such a short distance. The young
men are generally rather eager to bring over despatches,
but I rather think this one won't try it again, in winter
at any rate. I am extraordinarily lucky in my crossings,
because probably I am a good sailor. I go backward and
forward in all seasons and always have good weather.
The Florians have had some wonderful crossings, nine
hours between Calais and Dover, both of them <em>tied</em> in
their chairs, and the chairs tied to the mast.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, March 12, 1891.</p>

<p>Yesterday we were at Windsor to dine and sleep. The
party was small&mdash;Staal, the Russian Ambassador, Lord
Hartington, Sir Frederick Leighton, Lord and Lady
Curzon, Countess Perponcher and Count Seckendorff in
attendance on the Empress Frederick, and of course the
regular members of the Queen's Household. Lady Antrim
was in waiting. We assembled as usual in the long
corridor close to the door by which the Royal party entered.
We were all in black, as the Empress was there.
The Queen and the Empress came in together. The
Queen shook hands with me and the two Ambassadors&mdash;the
Empress with me only, bowing to the others. She is
still in deep mourning&mdash;her dress black (woollen stuff
of some kind) covered with cr&ecirc;pe, and a cr&ecirc;pe veil arranged
in a point, or sort of Mary Stuart cap, on the top
of her head, and falling behind to the edge of her skirt.
The corsage was a little open, and she had a splendid
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_311" title="pg 311"> </a>
necklace of pearls, also a miniature of the Emperor Frederick
set in diamonds fastened on the front of her bodice.
The dress was very becoming&mdash;she looked very stately
and graceful as she walked through the corridor. She
gave her arm to the Queen, and they walked in first to
the dining-room, the Empress sitting next to the Queen
on her right. W. followed with Princess Beatrice, sitting
on the Queen's left; Staal with Princess Margaretta,
and sat on the right of the Empress. Lord Hartington
took me. The Queen talked a great deal to W.&mdash;the
Empress joined in occasionally. They were both
much interested in the Protestants in France, and wanted
to know if the feeling was as strong as in the old days
of Huguenots and Catholics. I think there is a very
strong feeling, and it is rare when a French Protestant
marries a Catholic&mdash;rarer still when they become Catholics.</p>

<p>The dinner is always quickly served, and the conversation
nil. Nobody talks except those who are next the
Princesses. The cercle was, as usual, in the corridor
between the two doors. The Queen stood a little, but not
all the time. She spoke to me about Johannes Wolff&mdash;admired
his playing so much. The Empress talked a
long time to W., and spoke immediately about her visit
to Paris and Versailles, which was rather awkward for
him, as he regretted very much that she had gone. All
the first part of her stay went so well. She told W.
she had had nothing but respect, and even sympathy
wherever she had been, and that she was much astonished
and distressed when she saw the papers and
found what a storm was raging in the press. The
Queen said a few words to me about the visit, and
seemed to think it was a radical demonstration
against the Government. I answered vaguely that all
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_312" title="pg 312"> </a>
radicals made mischief&mdash;it wasn't a very easy subject
to discuss. The cercle was not very long&mdash;about
three-quarters of an hour&mdash;and then the Court retired,
the two Sovereigns going out as they came in,
together. We finished the evening in the drawing-room,
but broke up early. W. went off to smoke, and I had a
nice hour in the beautiful little yellow salon. I had a
splendid fire, quantities of candles (always my mania&mdash;I
hate lamps, particularly in these days of petroleum),
and was quite happy. Adela&iuml;de was very eloquent over
the style of the housekeeper's room, and was funny over
Charles, our French footman, and his indignation at
being excluded from the society of the valets and ladies'
maids. W.'s man was ill, so he took the French footman,
who has often done his service. That gentleman
being in livery was considered one of the lower servants
(sat some way below the salt) and when the swells (Adela&iuml;de,
of course, included) retired to the housekeeper's
room for dessert and coffee he remained with the under
servants. All these domestic arrangements are quite unheard
of in France&mdash;any distinctions of that kind would
set the whole establishment in a storm.</p>

<p>It was a cold night, snow lying thick on the ground,
clouds dark and low, and the great towers looked grim
and formidable. W. came in about 12&mdash;said the talk in
the fumoir was pleasant. He likes Count Seckendorff
very much, finds him intelligent and moderate and sensible
in his opinions&mdash;like all men who have knocked about
a great deal and who know, not only other countries but
the <em>people</em> of the country. After all, churches, and palaces,
and picture galleries have a certain "resemblance,"
but people are different, and sometimes very interesting.
We came away this morning at 10.30. I did not see
anyone except Lady Antrim, as I never go to the dining-room
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_313" title="pg 313"> </a>
for breakfast. I was ready a little before the time,
and wandered about the corridor a little, looking at all
the pictures. I met Staal doing the same thing. There
is so much to see.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful bright day, and Hyde Park looked
very animated as we drove through. Everyone was
waiting to see the Queen pass. She arrived about an
hour after us, as there is a Drawing-room to-morrow.
We had some music this afternoon&mdash;2 pianos, 8 hands&mdash;and
we play rather well a splendid symphony of Brahms'&mdash;not
at all easy. We dined with Mr. Henry Petre, one
of the most soign&eacute; dinners in London. It is always
pleasant at his house&mdash;they say it is because he is a bachelor,
which is not very flattering to <em>us</em>, but I think it is
true, I don't know why. As we were out we <em>went on</em>,
as they say here, to Lady Aberdeen, who had a small
dance, but did not stay very long, as it was rather a
young company. People always say there is nothing
going on in London before the season, but we dine out
every night and often have (I at least) something in the
afternoon&mdash;a tea, or music. I don't believe anybody
ever dines at home in London. The theatres are always
crowded, quite as much as in Paris. Hilda and I went
the other night with Count Seckendorff to see "Charlie's
Aunt," a ridiculous farce which is having a great success.
He protested at first at our choice&mdash;would have
preferred something more classic, but he was perfectly
amused (though protesting all the time). The piece is
absolutely stupid, but so well played that the house was
in roars of laughter, and that is always infectious. The
man who played the part of the maiden aunt was extraordinarily
well got up. His black silk dress and mittens
were lovely&mdash;he looked really a prim old spinster and
managed his skirts so well.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, April 4, 1891.</p>

<p>We lunched to-day with Ferdinand Rothschild to meet
the Empress Frederick. We were a small party, principally
Diplomatists. The Deyms, Hatzfeldt, Soveral,
Harry Whites, etc. The Empress came (punctually)
with Countess Perponcher and Seckendorff. The lunch
was very handsome, quickly served and very animated,
everybody talked. I had Hatzfeldt on the other side (I
sat between him and Rothschild) so I was quite happy&mdash;there
is nobody I like so much to talk to. He is very
clever, very entrain, speaks French beautifully and talks
about anything&mdash;just enough "moqueur" to keep one's
wits sharpened. We had a discussion as to what was
the origin of "Mrs. Grundy." None of us knew. I
must ask Jusserand, who will I am sure be able to tell us.</p>

<p>We were all dressed in black velvet, one would have
thought it was a "mot d'ordre." The Empress is very
easy and likes to talk. She asked me if I knew D&eacute;roul&egrave;de,
said she heard some of his poetry was charming. I
told her the "Chants du Soldat" were delightful, but <em>I</em>
couldn't send them to her (they are all about the Franco-German
War). One of the ladies, Mrs. White I think,
said she would.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, April 21, 1891.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant little dinner Sunday night for
Wormser, the composer of "L'Enfant Prodigue," which
has had an enormous success here. Wolff came too, and
they played all the evening. I haven't seen the piece yet,
so I was delighted to hear the music. I promised him I
would go on Wednesday, my first free night.</p>

<p>Last night I went with Lady Northcote to the Opera;
it was "Lohengrin" with Miss Eames and the Reszkes.
The girl looked beautiful, quite the patrician maiden,
and sang very well; a little cold, but that was of less
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_315" title="pg 315"> </a>
importance in that opera than in "Romeo and Juliet,"
which needs more passion. The house was very full and
she was much applauded. Jean de Reszke looked magnificent
and sang divinely. What a voice it is, and how
well he knows how to use it. I fancy Covent Garden is
a much better salle to sing in than our great Paris Op&eacute;ra.
The voices seem so far off there, and all the singers complain
and get soon tired. W. came in late just as I did.
He had had a delightful dinner at Mr. Murray's (the
publisher) with Mr. Gladstone. He said Mr. G. was in
great form, talking about everything: books, politics,
theories, and always with a perfect knowledge of each
subject expressed in beautiful English. He must have a
marvellous memory.</p>

June 6, 1891.</p>

<p>You will be amused, Dear, to hear that after all we
have decided to have the children's comedy. The moment
is not exactly propitious in the height of the London
season when every instant is taken, but I think we
can make something pretty, and Mdme. Th&eacute;nard is very
keen about it. We shall take the "Reine des F&eacute;es"&mdash;but
very much changed, and parts added for every child&mdash;also
a gavotte and a chorus. I saw some of the mammas,
Countess Deym; Mdme. de Bille; Ladies Londonderry,
Clanwilliam, etc., yesterday, and they will let me
have their daughters. Th&eacute;nard will direct the whole
thing, with Count de St. Genys (Secretary of the French
Embassy in London) as r&eacute;gisseur and also d&eacute;corateur, as
he has begun painting a charming d&eacute;cor (the interior of
the bailiff's cottage). Mdme. de Langhe will undertake
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_316" title="pg 316"> </a>
the ch&oelig;urs and le&ccedil;ons de diction, and I don't quite know
yet whom we shall get for the gavotte, or how many
children we must have. The dresses will be pretty&mdash;two
sets&mdash;Marie Antoinette and all her ladies in powder&mdash;Trianon
costumes&mdash;and peasants, market women, etc.
Of course the boys are a difficulty. There are so few
who are here of Francis's old friends&mdash;they are all at
school. Th&eacute;nard has a little friend (girl) whom she will
dress as a Marquis&mdash;she says she will look the part very
well. Francis is much excited&mdash;he is to be the cruel
bailiff who takes all the money and everything else he
can get from the poor peasants. St. Genys will see
about his costume, and make a croquis from some picture
of the period.</p>

<p class="author">June 12, 1891.</p>

<p>We are all (except the Ambassador) perfectly taken up
with the com&eacute;die&mdash;and to-day we had our first r&eacute;p&eacute;tition
of the gavotte in the drawing-room. I hadn't
thought of saying anything about the dancing to the
young men, and it seems the "chancellerie" went nearly
mad; their rooms being directly under the salons, they
heard everything&mdash;the music beginning the same thing
over and over again&mdash;and the heavy little feet that
couldn't stay long on the tips of their toes. I had some
trouble in finding a dancing-mistress&mdash;I thought first of
the American who had that dancing class here where all
the children went, but she didn't seem to understand exactly
what I wanted. Finally some one told me I had
much better send for Mrs. Roffy&mdash;ballet-mistress at the
Alhambra&mdash;who has sometimes arranged menuets and
gavottes for "les femmes du monde"; so I wrote to her
to come and see me. She knew exactly what I wanted,
would undertake the whole thing&mdash;how many children&mdash;what
sort of a dance&mdash;was most business-like&mdash;and we
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_317" title="pg 317"> </a>
fixed the first r&eacute;p&eacute;tition at once. There were about 20
children, of all ages and sizes, varying from 3 years to
14&mdash;Muriel White, Gay Edwardes and her brother, a
little de Breunen, Elsa Deichmann, etc. Mrs. Roffy
looked very nice. She is very tall, but rather graceful&mdash;she
had a little black bag in which were her black silk
stockings and pointed slippers, and asked if she might
have a room to arrange herself&mdash;so Clarisse took charge
of her. I took the piano&mdash;and most distracting it was&mdash;as
no two of the children ever began their steps at the
same time. It was amusing to see Mrs. Roffy. She
moved extraordinarily gracefully for such a tall woman,
and was so patient&mdash;holding up her dress, pointing her
toes, and talking to them all the time&mdash;"Heads up,
Dears&mdash;Heads up! Look at me&mdash;very proud, please." I
should have given up in despair after a quarter of an
hour. All the little arms and legs went at wrong times
in wrong directions, and no one seemed to have the
slightest idea of time. She will give one or two private
lessons to some of the very small ones.</p>

<p>Madame de Langhe, too, has her hands full with the
chorus, "Vive la Reine"&mdash;but I think she must have some
one behind the scenes to sing the solo, and then the
children will come out strong in the chorus. The r&ocirc;les
are all distributed&mdash;Bianca Deym&mdash;a tall handsome
girl&mdash;is to be Marie Antoinette; and the various other
Court ladies are Lady Helen Stewart (Lady Londonderry's
daughter), Lady J. Meade (Lady Clanwilliam's
daughter), Marguerite Phelps, Anna Lawrence, Elsa de
Bille, etc. I think it will be pretty.</p>

<p class="author">June 15, 1891.</p>

<p>Hilda and I have been half over London to-day for
our stage scenes. We must have real ones representing
a sort of wood where the market people have their
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_318" title="pg 318"> </a>
stands, and the Queen and the ladies come to buy flowers&mdash;also
sufficient space for the gavotte. The man
promises to send it all the day before, as the children
must rehearse at least once with the real scenes&mdash;for their
entr&eacute;es&mdash;that is always a little difficulty. The bigger
girls do all right, but the little ones rush in&mdash;speak very
quickly&mdash;and <em>always</em> to Th&eacute;nard, who stands at one
side&mdash;looking hard at her to see if they are doing right&mdash;and
paying no attention whatever to Her Gracious Majesty
Queen Marie Antoinette. Muriel White is very
good, very deliberate, very careful, and taking all the
French nuances and intonations very well. Gay Edwardes,
too, is very good&mdash;her French is pretty and easy,
she learnt it so young in Paris. One of the others (I
forget which one) was having a private lesson in a corner
with Francis, who was trying to make her roll her
Rs in a proper French fashion. She had a complaint to
make of her garden&mdash;all about "carottes" et "girofl&eacute;es,"
and the sentences had a true British ring. Francis is
very important, takes himself quite "au s&eacute;rieux," and is
most interested in the proper diction of all the young
ladies. I sat some time in the drawing-room while St.
Genys was painting his scenes. We had various visitors
(even W., who was very complimentary over the d&eacute;cor),
tea, and Th&eacute;nard to settle about a rampe of flowers and
tapestry curtain.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, June 20, 1891.</p>

<p>I am rather lazy this morning and feel as if I had suddenly
nothing to do. The com&eacute;die went off very well
yesterday and was a pretty sight. Until the last moment
I was doubtful, as we had so many p&eacute;rip&eacute;ties. At the
dress rehearsal on Thursday, Bianca Deym (Marie Antoinette)
was so hoarse she could hardly speak. The
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_319" title="pg 319"> </a>
girl looked very handsome and distinguished in powder
(tr&eacute;s bien coiff&eacute;e) and one of her mother's handsome
Court dresses, but Th&eacute;nard wouldn't let her speak&mdash;said
all her part herself, and told Bianca to pay
great attention to her voice and gestures. Toupet
(Francis), the cruel bailiff, had such a stiff neck and sore
throat that he could hardly move&mdash;so he was rubbed
hard with Elliman's Embrocation and sent to bed as
soon as the r&eacute;p&eacute;tition was over. His costume was very
good&mdash;coat and long waistcoat of prune cloth&mdash;lace
jabot&mdash;tricorne and gold-headed cane lent by one of
his English cousins&mdash;a wig of course&mdash;which quite
changed him. The girls looked charming&mdash;I don't know
which was the most becoming&mdash;the powder and Court
dress or the short skirts and high caps of the paysannes.
The gavotte went very well. The small children in
front and the bigger ones behind. I never could have
believed that anyone could evolve anything like a
gavotte from the whirling chaos of arms and legs that
was my first impression. M. Lecomte (Secretary of the
Embassy), who is a very good musician, was at the piano,
and marked the time very exactly, which was absolutely
necessary for such young performers.</p>

<p>Various friends and Mammas came to look on and
criticise&mdash;which was what we wanted&mdash;and all were
pleased. Th&eacute;nard and St. Genys were quite delighted&mdash;and
as they have seen it from the first and noted the
improvement, that was reassuring. Henry Edwardes
came, much amused and slightly astonished at his children's
performance (the boy was so good). He told me
he considered it quite remarkable. He offered to take
charge of the green-room the day of the performance,
and I accepted with pleasure, as I am sure the children
will be rather excited and probably unruly.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_320" title="pg 320"> </a></p>

<p>I had a note from Miss Knollys while the r&eacute;p&eacute;tition
was going on saying that the Princess of Wales and her
two daughters, Princesses Victoria and Maud, would be
present on Friday at the performance. I announced this
at once to my young troupe, and they were filled with
pleasure and dismay at the appalling prospect of playing
before Royalties. I went for a ride Friday morning
with Pontavice and when I came in was given a wild
note from the Countess Deym saying that Bianca
had a complete "extinction de voix" and what could
be done. If someone else could take the part (which
was impossible at such short notice) she would send
all her daughter's dress, which was very handsome, or
Bianca would come and look the part and Th&eacute;nard do
the talking from the coulisses. Of course I chose the
latter, and sent off Clarisse at once to the Austrian Embassy
with a remedy that Mdme. Richard of the Op&eacute;ra
gave me. Francis was all right, his neck quite straight.
After breakfast I had a last practice with him and Lecomte
for the gavotte. I got in a small piano from &Eacute;rard
(my big one took up too much room behind the scenes)
and then I dismissed the whole thing from my mind, and
went to dress. I told the children to be there at 4.30 so
as to begin the minute the Princess arrived. She said she
would come at five.</p>

<p>The little blue salon was a pretty sight when it was
filled with all the children in costume. Th&eacute;nard's Marquis
looked too sweet&mdash;she had dressed the girl so well
in satin coat, ruffles, and silk stockings, and enormous
paste buckles on her shoes. She did her part perfectly&mdash;so
easy, and such pretty French. The Princess came
punctually with her two daughters, and the play began at
once. I think there were about 100 people&mdash;we couldn't
seat any more as the stage took up a good deal of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_321" title="pg 321"> </a>
room. The prettiest scenes were the Trianon and the
Market Place. In the Trianon, Marie Antoinette was
seated surrounded by her ladies, and le Marquis telling
them "les petites nouvelles de la cour." The child
was killing when she took out her snuff-box and made
flowery phrases. The Market was very well arranged
with flowers and vegetables. Violet Freeman made a
splendid old woman at one stall, and Hilda Deichmann
did her boy's part very well. After the Queen had made
her round (her voice came back, though she was rather
hoarse still) she and her ladies retired a little to the
background, where the Court made a brilliant group,
while the peasants sang their chorus, "Vive la Reine."
Then came the gavotte, which really went extremely
well. Mrs. Roffy was breathless with recommendations
until the last moment. Both chorus and gavotte were
encored, and there was much applause when the curtain
fell.</p>

<p>The Princess, who is always so gracious, asked me
what I would like her to do, so I said if she would allow
the whole troupe to defile before her I would name each
one&mdash;and I knew it would give them great pleasure.
She agreed at once, so the procession, headed by Marie
Antoinette, passed, and the Princess shook hands with
every one, talking a little to those she knew. They all
applauded when Toupet, with his wig and cane, appeared.
Then I named Mdmes. Th&eacute;nard and Roffy&mdash;and I wish
you could have seen those ladies' curtseys (Mdme. Roffy's
particularly splendid), also St. Genys and Lecomte. The
whole thing lasted a short hour, even with the r&eacute;p&eacute;tition
of chorus and gavotte. We had tea in the drawing-room&mdash;the
children downstairs. The Princess told
me she thought it charming&mdash;quite wonderful. The only
two French children were Francis and the Marquis, but
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_322" title="pg 322"> </a>
I must say I thought the others quite wonderful. When
the Princess went away all the children assembled in the
hall at the foot of the stairs, bowing and curtseying&mdash;and
it was a pretty sight, such a mass of colour and
flushed, eager little faces. The Princess told them all
again how much she had enjoyed the performance, and
it was quite a happy little crowd that dispersed soon
afterward to their respective homes. W. complimented
Th&eacute;nard very much, who had given herself no end of
trouble&mdash;also Mdme. de Langhe, who had undertaken
the chorus. Some of the ladies were rather anxious we
should repeat the performance for the benefit of some
charity, but W. didn't like to have a paying thing at
the Embassy; and at one of the public halls it would not
have been very easy&mdash;some of the ladies objected.</p>

<p>I dined at home, but went to a concert in the evening,
and had various compliments for my troupe. The
Prince of Wales told me that the Princess had told him
it was quite charming. I think on the whole W. was
pleased. He was rather doubtful about inviting the Princess&mdash;thought
it was a little informal, and would bore
her, but I don't think it did.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, June 23, 1891.</p>

<p>We have had various notices in the French papers of
the com&eacute;die; generally "une bonne presse," but one or
two of the very Republican papers expressed great surprise
at such a <em>Royalist Demonstration</em>&mdash;couldn't imagine
<em>why</em> we had chosen that particular chorus, "Vive la
Reine," at an Embassy representing the French Republic!</p>

<p>I am sorry you couldn't come over&mdash;all the r&eacute;p&eacute;titions
would have amused you so much. Nothing was funnier
than to see Francis always in a corner with some of the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_323" title="pg 323"> </a>
girls. Madame Campan (Elsa de Bille) had a long thing
to say, and was most anxious to have the correct accent.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
July 8, 1891.</p>

<p>I dined quietly with some of the personnel last night,
and had Thekla Staal, as her mother and father had gone
to Windsor for the State banquet for the German Emperor.
Mdme. de Staal came in for a moment on her way
home&mdash;she said it was very handsome, very well done,
as it always is at Windsor, only they were all rather uncomfortable,
as they went down from London by special
train in full dress&mdash;diamonds and feathers&mdash;and when
they arrived at the Castle they were asked to take off
their wraps in the hall, no dressing-room of any kind
provided. I don't know what my erratic hair would have
looked like. Of course I couldn't go on account of my
mourning.</p>

<p>All London was on the "qui vive" this morning, as the
German Emperor was to make his formal entry into London.
I thought I wouldn't go in the carriage and take up
a position, so Mrs. Edwardes suggested that I should go
with her to Constitution Hill, where she had places, and
see the Emperor pass there; so we started off on foot
quite cheerfully, but as soon as we got outside the Park
and wanted to cross the Square, we were confronted by
lines of soldiers and policemen, who refused to let us pass.
I explained who I was and that I was merely going to
cross to Constitution Hill, but they evidently thought
nothing of an Ambassadress in a simple black dress with
neither equipage nor servants, and we were getting
rather discouraged when I saw a Park-keeper who knew
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_324" title="pg 324"> </a>
me, so he instantly went after one of the heads of the
mounted police, who appeared, made way for us and accompanied
us (he riding) across the Square. Some of
our friends, who were looking on from windows in the
houses opposite, were rather anxious&mdash;thought we had
been arrested. We waited a little while and very soon
the head of the procession appeared. We made ourselves
as small as we could and squeezed close up to the gate,
but the Horse Guards on their big, black horses came
unpleasantly near and the least plunge or kick would
have been disastrous. The Royal carriage passed quite
close to us at a quick trot. The Emperor looked very
wide-awake and soldierly in blue dragoon uniform; the
Empress, tall and fair, in white, was seated next to him;
the Prince of Wales and the Duke of Edinburgh on the
front seat. There was not much enthusiasm, a few hats
(not all) lifted. The Emperor saluted all the time,
mechanically. When he saw me he leaned forward,
smiled and bowed in evident recognition. I can't think
how he knew me, standing there in a crowd of nursery-maids
and children. He had seen me but twice before,
and then in the evening in full dress. I suppose it is that
extraordinary memory, instinct almost, that all Princes
have, and which does them such good service. Everyone
is pleased and flattered at being recognised by a Royalty.
I was, too, just like all the rest. I wasn't mistaken
in thinking he knew me. He told one of our secretaries
at the reception at the Palace that he had seen Mdme.
Waddington <em>standing</em> in the crowd.</p>

<p>Hilda came to dinner with Countess Eulenbourg (wife
of the Master of Ceremonies of the German Court) and
her boy. They were very late, as the Countess had been
to Buckingham Palace to see the Empress. She said the
confusion was something awful. She had great difficulty
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_325" title="pg 325"> </a>
in getting in, was sent from pillar to post and
finally the carriage was allowed to enter through the
stable-yard. She was glad to have a quiet evening. Her
husband was at the gala performance at the Opera with
the Emperor and Empress. She spoke a great deal
about the Emperor, said it was impossible to be with him
without feeling what a strong personality he is; that what
he felt was right and best for Germany he would certainly
do&mdash;also that he would never shirk a responsibility, or
put the blame on others if he made a mistake. It seems
curious to be suddenly out of everything. W. is still in
France<sup><a href="#fn11" id="r11">[11]</a></sup>
and of course our deep mourning makes all
Court and gala things impossible for us. I think W.
must come back before the Emperor goes and try to see
him in a private audience, if nothing else can be arranged.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, 9th.</p>

<p>All the Corps Diplomatique were received this morning
at Buckingham Palace&mdash;the men by the Emperor,
the women by the Empress. Hatzfeldt presented the
men. In W.'s absence, d'Estournelles represented the
Embassy (with all the secretaries of course). As he was
only Charg&eacute; d'Affaires, he could not take W.'s place as
Doyen at the head of the row&mdash;on the contrary, was
quite at the end; after all the Ministers of the small
Powers&mdash;however they made a little group apart. The
Emperor talked a little while to d'Estournelles&mdash;regretted
very much not seeing W.&mdash;knew that he was still
in France, and told him to tell me that he had recognised
me at once in the Park. He said a few words to each
member of the Embassy. The ladies were presented by
Mdme. de Staal&mdash;my young women told me she did it
very well, passing down the line with the Empress and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_326" title="pg 326"> </a>
naming every one. They also found the Empress very
gracious, saying something to each one&mdash;of course there
is never any real conversation on such occasions, people
are usually in a hurry and anxious to get through their
<em>function</em>.</p>

<p>This afternoon was the garden party at Marlborough
House&mdash;Mdme. d'Estournelles and Florian came in afterward
to tell me about it; also Mme. de Bille (wife
of the Danish Minister), she is an American, n&eacute;e Zabriskie.
They said there was a great crowd, and such a
hedge of loyal subjects around the Royalties that it was
almost impossible to see them even. Princess of Monaco
(n&eacute;e Heine), who was with the Court (her husband
being a "prince regnant," of a minute principality certainly),
made a sign to Countess de Florian to come and
speak to her, and she also had quite a talk with Princess
Am&eacute;lie of Schleswig Holstein, cousin of the German
Emperor, whom she had known as a girl in Pau, when
her father, Marquis de Nadaillac, was Pr&eacute;fet there.
Staal came in late, and hopes that W. will come back
(he is always such a good colleague). He thinks it will
make a bad effect, the French Ambassador being the
only one absent. He thinks he ought to come over
for the breakfast at the Mansion House, which is strictly
official, and where the Emperor will probably make a
speech. I will write to him to-night and tell him what
they all say.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, July 10th.</p>

<p>I rode this morning with Pontavice, the Military Attach&eacute;,
and just missed the Emperor, who was riding with
six or seven officers, all in uniform, which seems strange,
as the officers never wear uniform except when they are
on duty. We sometimes see the officer of the day riding
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_327" title="pg 327"> </a>
in the Row in uniform, but never any other. In Paris it
is quite different; all the officers of the Paris garrison,
which is a very large one, always ride in uniform in the
Bois in the morning. I went to the War Office afterward
to see the Emperor, Empress, and Prince and
Princess pass on their way to the Lord Mayor's banquet.
The display of troops was rather mesquin&mdash;the Grenadiers
standing so far apart that there were groups of
street boys in between. The Royalties were fairly applauded
(the Prince and Princess are always whenever
they appear). The Emperor was in a white uniform,
but his helmet is so big and heavy and so low on his face
that one could hardly see him. Francis and I dined
quietly at the Russian Embassy, and the Staals told us
all about the various f&ecirc;tes. They said the getting away
from the Mansion House was awful&mdash;when the gentlemen
of the household were trying to make a passage for
the Princess of Wales there was a general skirmish, one
of the ladies of the Corps Diplomatique was struck on
the shoulder by one of the gentlemen, and there was a
fine row&mdash;the husband of the lady furious, the unfortunate
equerry protesting, saying he was incapable of
such an enormity, etc. However, excuses were made
and peace restored.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, July 11th.</p>

<p>I rode this morning with Pontavice, and we met the
Emperor, also riding, several times; but he did <em>not</em> recognise
me this time in my habit. He had six or seven officers
with him and two grooms. All the officers, the
Emperor also, in uniform, and wearing those long German
sabres that hang loose and make a great clatter.
They all rode at a gallop and set all the horses in the Row
by the ears. I really had some trouble with my quiet animal,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_328" title="pg 328"> </a>
who was jumping and kicking all over the place. I
had several visits at tea-time. My windows and balconies
giving on the Park are most attractive, as there
are quantities of people about&mdash;a sort of general excitement
in the air, and royal carriages and soldiers passing
all the time. D'Estournelles came in and told me about
the review. He said the troops looked splendid, but the
arrangements were very bad&mdash;no seats reserved&mdash;he and
his wife and many ladies standing all the time. Mme.
d'Estournelles was dead tired and had gone home to bed.
W. came back for dinner; he looks grave and sad. We
sat on the balcony after dinner while he smoked. He
said he must go to the luncheon at Hatfield for the Emperor
and Empress. As long as he was Ambassador, he
had no right to let any private grief prevent his taking
part in a public function, particularly in this case, when
his absence might be misconstrued.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, July 18th.</p>

<p>I went this afternoon to consult some of my colleagues
about my dress for Hatfield. Of course I am in deep
mourning, and I didn't know if I could meet Royalties in
black. At some Courts, Russia for instance, black is not
allowed&mdash;when people are in mourning they wear white.
After various consultations, I decided that I would go in
my black dress; so I have had some lace put on top of
the flounce of "cr&eacute;pon de laine," which is really very deep
mourning.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author">Tuesday, July 19, 1891.</p>

<p>We had a most interesting day at Hatfield, and evidently
we were right in going. We went down by a
special, W. in deep mourning, I in my black cr&eacute;pon, my
big pearls in my ears and around my neck, a little cr&ecirc;pe
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_329" title="pg 329"> </a>
bonnet (with a soup&ccedil;on of jet) and an ordinary dotted
tulle veil. All our colleagues were most empress&eacute;s and
nice&mdash;said it had been so strange not to see either of us
at any of the f&ecirc;tes. There were, as usual, a certain number
of young men, sons of the house, secretaries, etc., at
the station at Hatfield; plenty of carriages, and in a few
minutes we were at the house. We passed straight
through the rooms to the terrace, where a very smart
company was assembled. Some of the young women in
white satin and lace, high bodices of course, all very
much dressed, and all with necklaces and jewels on their
corsages. No one in particular received us. Lady Salisbury
was driving with the Empress, Lord Salisbury talking
with the Prince of Wales, and the Emperor riding.
(The Salisburys had an enormous house party, all arrived
the night before for dinner&mdash;the Emperor and Empress
with their suite, also the Prince and Princess and
theirs.) I was strolling about the terrace with Countess
Deym when we came suddenly upon the Princess of
Wales, walking about with her "Kodak" and looking
about 25 in her simple grey foulard and big black hat.
As we went up to speak to her, she made us a sign to
stop, saying "I want you in my picture." We talked to
her a little while and then she said she must go and make
herself "smart" for the lunch-party. There was still
some time before there was any sign of Princes&mdash;or
lunch. Mr. Barrington asked us to stand near the perron,
as he had charge of the placing of the people. The
Emperor and Empress appeared first, and immediately
made a sort of cercle. Lady Salisbury presented me at
once to the Empress, and she was most amiable, regretted
not having seen me at the reception at Buckingham Palace,
adding, "J'ai vu toutes vos jeunes femmes, plus jolies
les unes que les autres." The Emperor, too, was easy and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_330" title="pg 330"> </a>
pleasant, but so many people were brought up to him all
the time that he couldn't talk much. It was interesting
to watch him. He was of course <em>the</em> central figure, and
there is always a certain curiosity as to what he will do.
He holds himself very straight, has a stern face and
rather a stiff manner, not particularly gracious, speaks
English of course perfectly well (in fact looks like an
Englishman, particularly in ordinary dress&mdash;of course
the uniform changes him a little). I think he knew about
everybody who was presented to him; soldiers, statesmen,
artists, and seemed to be interested in the very short
talks he had with each one. He and W. had quite a talk,
and he again expressed his regret at not having seen him
before, and also for the cause which had kept him away.
The Prince and Princess stood about on the terrace while
all the presentations were going on, talking to their
friends. After about half an hour there was a move to
the great dining-hall. I think there were about 150
guests. The Royalties and swells lunched in the great
hall at small tables of ten, and the others in the ordinary
dining-room. I was at Lord Salisbury's table, who took
in the Empress; the Prince took me; Hatzfeldt (German
Ambassador) Mdme. de Staal; Rustem (Turkish Ambassador)
Princess Maud; Soveral (Portuguese Minister)
Countess Spencer. At Lady Salisbury's table were
the Emperor, Princess, Staal, W., etc. The talk was
fairly easy at our table&mdash;Hatzfeldt said to me rather
pointedly, "Je suis tr&egrave;s heureux de vous voir ici aujourd'hui,
Madame Waddington." The Prince also said we
were quite right to come. I said I thought my plain
black dress was rather out of place at such a brilliant
entertainment, but he assured me it was quite correct.</p>

<p>About half way through luncheon came the pearl necklace
incident (which you saw in the papers). I suddenly
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_331" title="pg 331"> </a>
felt that my necklace was unclasped. It was sewed on
the corsage in front, as the pearls are large and heavy,
and I am always afraid of breaking the string. I asked
Soveral, who was next to me, if he couldn't clasp it for
me. He tried, but was nervous or awkward; at any rate
couldn't manage it, and we were both getting red and
flustered when suddenly we heard the Emperor from his
table calling W.'s attention to the fact that "le Portugal
&eacute;tait en train d'&eacute;trangler la France"; also Staal, saying
that his "Coll&egrave;gue du Portugal se livrait &agrave; une gymnastique
&eacute;trange." They all made various jokes at my expense,
and the Prince said "Let me do it," but he couldn't
either, and again we heard the Emperor remarking,
"Maintenant c'est plus s&eacute;rieux&mdash;l'Angleterre s'en m&ecirc;le."
W., who had his back to me and who couldn't see what
was going on, was decidedly mystified, and wondered
what on earth I was doing to attract so much attention,
in fact was rather annoyed. When we got up from table
the Prince and I retreated to a corner of the terrace, and
he cut the stitches that held the necklace in front with his
knife (which again looked funny to the people assembled
on the terrace). He advised me to put the pearls, <em>not</em> in
my pocket, but in a safe place, as they were very handsome,
so I put them <em>inside</em> my dress. Of course everybody
asked me what had happened, and what the Emperor
was saying to me from the other table. I asked the
Empress if she was never afraid of losing her pearls, but
she said all her jewels were most carefully sewn on and
strung on a very thick string or sort of silk cord.</p>

<p>Very soon after lunch the Emperor and Empress left,
as they were starting in the evening for Germany, and
had to go to Windsor to take leave of the Queen. The
Prince and Princess followed quickly, and then, of course,
all of us. W. had again a talk with the Emperor, and all
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_332" title="pg 332"> </a>
his colleagues told him he was quite right to come. Any
little incident between France and Germany always assumes
gigantic proportions, and the papers, both French
and German, would have been full of the <em>marked</em> absence
of the French Ambassador from all the f&ecirc;tes for
the Emperor; his mourning a pretext, etc. It was a beautiful
entertainment&mdash;bright, perfect summer day, quantities
of pretty women beautifully dressed (a great many
in white) and representative people of all kinds. The
general impression was that the Emperor was not a
lady's man&mdash;he evidently preferred talking to army and
political men. My talk with him was so perfectly banal
that I can scarcely have an opinion, but I should think
one might talk to him easily. His face is certainly stern,
and the manner very cold, but his smile, like the Queen's,
lights up and softens the face. I said to one of the
pretty young women who had made a luncheon-party for
him, that I had heard that it was beautifully done, and
that he was much pleased. She said she hoped he was,
that as far as she personally was concerned he hadn't the
slightest idea whether she was 25 or 50.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>,<br >
January 12, 1892.</p>

<p>W. and I came over yesterday in a snowstorm.
It was beastly getting out of the train and on the
boat at Calais. I am rather depressed, having left Francis
behind at a professor's near the Lyc&eacute;e Janson, to
follow the cours there as externe. I shall miss him
frightfully, but it was quite time for him to go to France
and go through the regular course. He was forgetting
his French here. Of course he and his father always
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_333" title="pg 333"> </a>
speak French to each other, but he went to a little English
school, Miss Quirim's, in Sloane Street (where
there were quantities of little friends beginning their education),
played all day with English children, heard
nothing else spoken around him, and was rapidly becoming
an Englishman. The house seems dreadfully quiet
without him, and poor little Bonny, the fox-terrier, is
miserable. He couldn't think why he wasn't with us to-day
on our journey and galloped up to his room as soon
as he arrived at the Embassy, asking everybody really
with his eyes where his master was. Florian came in at
once to see us, and told us that the Duke of Clarence was
frightfully ill at Sandringham. He always looked rather
delicate, tall and slight and colourless, but I hope his
youth will pull him through. He had been rather more
en &eacute;vidence these last months since his engagement to
Princess May, daughter of Princess Mary, Duchess of
Teck. I think it is a marriage that pleases the nation.
Princess May is young and pretty, with a pretty figure
and essentially English&mdash;born and brought up in the
country. Everybody adores her mother, Princess Mary,
and I think it will be a very happy marriage.</p>

<p class="author">January 13, 1892.</p>

<p>I am afraid there is no chance for the poor young
Prince. Florian came in for a moment, just back from
Marlborough House, where the bulletins are posted twice
a day. There were crowds of people reading them and
trying to get some detailed information. Florian saw
one of the equerries, who told him there was no hope, he
was sinking fast and would probably not live through
the night. He told him the Princess never left him and
was heart-broken, her eldest boy. It is hard for her.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_334" title="pg 334"> </a>
They seem to think it was a neglected cold, caught out
shooting, and not taken in time. All the personnel came
in to see me and brought their New Year's present&mdash;4
pretty corbeilles for bonbons. They always give me
something New Year's Day and I am much pleased to
have the souvenirs. I can hardly realise that we have
been here nearly 9 years. We came in '83 and thought
we should stay perhaps two years. I am so accustomed
to the life now that I feel as if I had always spent half
the year in England and the other half in France. I suppose
I shall miss a great many things when we retire into
private life, perhaps most of all the family life with all
the personnel of the Embassy. We have had various
changes, of course, but I generally pull well with them
all, and I must say they are always ready to help me in
every way. I haven't had too many women, which is
pleasant; women are much more complicated to deal with
than men&mdash;there are always so many small jealousies
and rivalries.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, January 14, 1892.</p>

<p>The poor young Duke is dead at 9 o'clock this morning,
in spite of all that tender nursing and skill could do.
He had not strength to fight against the malady. It is
awfully hard at his age and in his position; just now,
too, when his marriage was so popular. Florian came
at once to tell us, and said there was such a crowd outside
Marlborough House that he could hardly get through
into the court, where the policeman showed him the
Prince of Wales's telegram, "All is over." We had
various visits at tea-time; Deym among others, who had
done just what we did&mdash;sent telegrams to the Prince
and Princess and the Tecks at Sandringham. He told
me he had dined at White Lodge with the Tecks on
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_335" title="pg 335"> </a>
Christmas Eve (for their Christmas tree) and that they
were all so happy. Princess Mary took him upstairs and
showed him all the presents&mdash;coupons of velvet, brocade,
etc., for dresses, also the wedding dress, and said to him,
"Je suis si heureuse que j'en ai peur." Poor thing; perhaps
it was a presentiment. I am awfully sorry for them,
for her perhaps more than for Princess May, who is
young and must of course get over it, as youth happily
is elastic and rebounds; but Princess Mary is different.
She has her share of worries and disappointments, and
she was so happy and proud of the marriage. It must
be an awful blow to her.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, January 19, 1892.</p>

<p>I went to the little church behind the Embassy this
morning and am very sorry now that I didn't go to St.
Paul's, where there was a fine service&mdash;the organ playing
the Dead March in Saul, and all the congregation
standing, a good many women crying, all in black.
It was impressive in the little church&mdash;everyone in black.
There is a general mourning ordered for three weeks,
and Court mourning for six (which is a shorter time
than I thought). (I send on a sheet apart what I would
like you to order for me. I have nothing black but my
black satin evening dress, which fortunately is all black,
no white, lace, or colour). They sang the funeral hymn
"Labourer, thy work is o'er," the first time I had ever
heard it, and beautiful it was; read the prayer for the
"Royal Family in affliction," and one for the influenza&mdash;which
surprised me, as I should not have thought the
epidemic was bad enough for that. The sermon, of
course, was all about Prince Eddie and the young life
cut short. It was very simple and earnest and the congregation
certainly felt and showed great sympathy. I
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_336" title="pg 336"> </a>
went for a short turn in the Park afterward and walked
about a little with Henry Edwardes and his children.
He is rather down, poor fellow, as his cong&eacute; drags on
and they seem in no hurry at the Foreign Office to give
him another post. I believe he didn't get on very well
with his last chief, and of course all chiefs are not commodes,
but equally of course when there comes a question
the secretary is <em>always</em> in the wrong. Edwardes is
very clever and cultivated. W. thinks him an excellent
agent. In Paris he always knew what was going on,
and knew so many people of all kinds.</p>

<p>This afternoon I had my usual Sunday visits&mdash;principally
diplomatists this time, and all talking about Prince
Eddie's funeral. It seems a pity they don't make a grand
military funeral, the procession passing through London.
There was such a striking outburst of sympathy and
loyalty when his death was announced that the people
would have been glad to associate themselves with the
last rites. They don't invite all the Chefs de Mission to
the funeral at Windsor (which also seems strange, Prince
Eddie being the heir), merely those of the "Cours apparent&eacute;es."
That will take in Hatzfeldt, German Ambassador;
Staal, Russian; de Bille, Danish Minister;
Gennadius, Greece; Soveral, Portugese; and Solvyns,
Belgian. All the others go to a special service at St.
James's Chapel, in uniform.</p>

<p class="author">Wednesday, January 20, 1892.</p>

<p>To-day is the funeral. Our flag is half-mast, and all
the windows shut in the drawing-rooms. It is mild
and damp, but not cold. Mdme. de Florian and I have
been driving about this afternoon to have an impression
of the streets. All the shops are shut, blinds down
in all the houses, flags at half-mast, and everyone in
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_337" title="pg 337"> </a>
black. Some of the hansom cab drivers with bits of
black ribbon or stuff on their whips, and everybody looks
grave. I can't help thinking it was a pity not to let the
people participate in the mourning and feel they were
taking some part. In these days of democracy one
should take any chance of strengthening the feeling of
loyalty. W. went off in uniform, with cr&ecirc;pe on sleeve
and sword hilt, at 3, to the service at the Chapel Royal,
St. James's, which seems to have been rather mild. The
diplomatists (4 Ambassadors), Chefs de Mission, were
received by Mr. Eric Barrington, Lord Salisbury's secretary;
Mr. Thomas Sanderson, and Colonel Chaine.</p>

<p>W. dined in the evening with Hilda, to meet Count
Seckendorff and B&uuml;low, who had come over from Germany
to the funeral. They said the service was very
simple and impressive, and that the Prince of Wales and
Prince George looked badly, the Prince of Wales much
agitated. Seckendorff said he could just manage to speak
to them when they all filed past him after the ceremony.
The Princesses were all in the chapel in a sort of gallery.
Quite at the end the Prince stepped forward and laid a
white wreath (given by Princess May) on the coffin.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, January 30, 1892.</p>

<p>It is still very mild and damp, rather dismal weather,
and the streets are depressing, everyone in black&mdash;the
mourning is very general, not at all confined to the fashionable
world. Mdme. de Florian and I drove out to
White Lodge, and cheerless it looked, so lonely and sad
with the black winter trees all around the house. We
did not see either of the Princesses; they were in London,
but Teck came out to speak to us. I never saw him appear
so well&mdash;he was so simple and distressed for his
daughter. He said she was very quiet, but perfectly
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_338" title="pg 338"> </a>
heart-broken, and that he had always had a presentiment
that something would happen&mdash;everything had gone too
smoothly. He said the coming back there after the
funeral was something too awful&mdash;all the wedding presents
and stuffs and laces scattered about the rooms&mdash;letters
and telegrams of congratulation, bouquets of white
flowers, in fact all the preparations for a wedding; and
at the same time people waiting to try on mourning&mdash;telegrams
of condolence, etc. What a tragedy! He said
he had no hope from the first. Prince Eddie was struck
down at once, and he didn't think the Princess of Wales
ever had a gleam of hope. She never left her boy until
all was over.</p>


<h3><em>To G. K. S.</em></h3>

<p class="author">Wednesday, February 10, 1892.</p>

<p>I went as usual to have tea with the Countess de
Bylandt this afternoon, who receives always Wednesday.
She always has plenty of people and one has a pleasant
hour. She was worried about her husband to-day, who is
ill. He is not very young and I should think has always
been delicate. He is Dutch Minister, and has been here
for years. She is a Russian born, very clever and amusing.
We dined with Baron Gevers, Dutch Secretary, at the
new restaurant or club, l'Amphytrion, which is supposed
to be the best and dearest in London. It is kept by &Eacute;mile,
a well-known Parisian. We were a <em>young</em> party, the
Florians, St. Genys, and the Lataings (Belgian Legation).
The dinner was excellent, certainly&mdash;&Eacute;mile knew
that his Ambassador was coming and had done his best.
He was always hovering about the table to see that all
was right, and we complimented him very much on the
way everything was cooked and served. I said to him
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_339" title="pg 339"> </a>
that he had very good material in London to work upon,
to which he replied, with magnificent contempt for anything
that was not French&mdash;"Il n'y a pas de march&eacute; &agrave;
Londres, je fais venir tout de Paris." When one thinks
of Covent Garden, with its piles of splendid salmon,
haunches of venison, hot-house fruits, grapes, pine-apples,
and <em>primeurs</em> of all kinds, the answer was amusing.
We went upstairs for coffee and cigarettes and had
a very pleasant evening. It is so good for W. to be
with young people occasionally. He talked a great deal,
and the young men were interested in some of his Cambridge
reminiscences.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, February 11, 1892.</p>

<p>It is still quite mild. After breakfast I went with
Hilda to the British Museum to hear a young Oxonian
lady lecture on Greek Antiquities and the Eleusinian
Mysteries. She did it very easily&mdash;a pretty, cultivated
voice and very distinct pronunciation. The lecture lasted
about an hour. She had all sorts of photographs of bas-reliefs,
statues, paintings, etc., and it was very interesting,
much more so than I expected, as Greek antiquities
are not much in my line. After the lecture was over,
Mr. Thomson, the director of the Museum (a charming
man), came to get us and showed us as much as we
could see before 4, when it gets dark and the Museum is
shut. The reading-room and library are enormous, and
for London very light. The collection of missals, autographs,
etc., is splendid. Some of the old, old missals
so beautiful still, the colours so wonderfully preserved.
We went to Mr. Thomson's room in the Museum building
for tea. His daughter was there and gave us very
good tea and muffins. Altogether we had a most interesting
afternoon. We dined with Mrs. Mitford (widow of
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_340" title="pg 340"> </a>
Percy Mitford, diplomatist). She has a very pretty and
original house and is a very easy hostess, having lived
much abroad. She is a great friend of Princess Mary and
told me I ought to go and see her. Mr. Lincoln, the
American Minister, was there, and we all teased him
about the Presidential election (the papers say he is to be
the next President). Mdme. de Bille and I told him we
were racking our brains to think what we could ask him
for our friends at home when he would be at the White
House. He assured us there was no possible chance of
it, and no one would be as sorry as he himself if ever the
thing came to pass. It certainly would be difficult to be
a second President Lincoln.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, February 19, 1892.</p>

<p>It is still very cold, snow lying on the ground (in
the parks), which is rare in London. I have just had
a little note from Princess Mary, asking me to come and
see her on Sunday at White Lodge, as she leaves early
in the week for the Riviera. Wolff came in late to ask
me if I would take him out to White Lodge, as Princess
Mary had also written to him to come. He had his violin,
so he played for about an hour, and most enchanting
it was. I occasionally forgot about the accompaniment,
listening to his beautiful long notes. He didn't mind,
was standing in the middle of the room (playing by
heart) and went on quite serenely until I caught him up
somewhere and went on again. I dined quietly with
Jean (as W. had a man's dinner at one of the clubs)
and we made music all the evening. She is very busy
translating a German book, Lady Blennerhasset's "Life
of Madame de Sta&euml;l." It looked easy at first, but I fancy
is rather a formidable undertaking, as Lady B. has a very
distinct style&mdash;very German, and I should think it must
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_341" title="pg 341"> </a>
lose in translation. She had rather come to grief over
one page. I looked over it, and said I didn't find it <em>very</em>
difficult, and I know German well, upon which she replied,
"Please read it out to me, then, in good English."
I began, but came to grief at once. I had got the meaning
right enough in my head, but couldn't at all express
it at once in correct or fluent English, and I don't know
that a dictionary would have helped me much. It was
more the turn of the phrase and a peculiar form of expression.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, February 21, 1892.</p>

<p>It is very mild to-day&mdash;a complete thaw. Wolff came
to breakfast, also Mdme. de Florian, and we drove out to
White Lodge for tea. It was pleasant enough driving,
as there was no wind, but the park and place looked
dreary. I had always seen it so gay, with so many young
people about, that I could hardly realise that it was the
same house. We were expected&mdash;two or three footmen
in deep mourning were at the door and took us at once
to the drawing-room. In a few minutes the three appeared:
father, mother, and daughter. I was rather
nervous, but they were so natural, it was such real grief,
that we felt quite at our ease, and so sorry for them all.
Princess May looked lovely. She has grown much thinner,
and the long black dress covered with cr&ecirc;pe, with
the white collar and cuffs (that all widows wear in England),
was most becoming. Her complexion was beautiful,
so delicate, and her eyes had that peculiar bright
look that one sees in people who have cried a great deal.
Before tea I had a long talk with Princess Mary, who
said that it all seemed a dream&mdash;the first days at White
Lodge, when the young couple were so happy, making
all sorts of plans, for their future seemed so bright and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_342" title="pg 342"> </a>
brilliant; so convinced that long years of happiness and
usefulness were before them that she was frightened
sometimes, and used to tell them that there would be great
cares and responsibilities in their position, and that they
must both help each other as much as they could (she
said Prince Eddie was naturally timid, and rather disposed
to underrate his intelligence). Then came the
sudden change. Those terrible days at Sandringham,
where she hoped against hope, and then the coming back
to White Lodge, which must have been heart-breaking.
I only said a few words to Princess May as we were
going away, but Mdme. de Florian had some talk with
her. She said she felt stunned&mdash;could hardly believe that
all was over, but that she must try and take up her life
again. "It will be very hard; I suppose I was too happy."</p>

<p>They are starting at once for the South, and I hope it
will do her good. Various people came in, among others
Mrs. Mitford, who is a devoted friend of the Tecks, and
so sorry for them. She said it was melancholy to see
them the first days after they got back to White Lodge.
All the presents had to be put away or sent back; all the
letters and telegrams sorted and put away, and that
Princess May moved about like a ghost.</p>

<p>We had a quiet evening until some late telegrams came
announcing a Ministerial crisis in France, for nothing
apparently. W. and his secretaries were disgusted.
There are so many changes in France, and we never
know who is coming to the Foreign Office. I think it
is time for us to go back. We have been away a long
time, and it isn't good for a man to live too much out
of his own country.</p>

<p>It is very cold and foggy this morning, impossible to
ride; we see all the grooms exercising the saddle horses
in the Park. I went for tea as usual to Mdme. de Bylandt.
He is still in his bed, and very bad I imagine. This evening
we have been to "Venice," the great show at Olympia.
We went a family party (Embassy), Florians, St. Genys,
Pontavice, d'Agoult. It is really very prettily done; you
must see it when you come over. We had a capital box
directly in the centre of the house, but the director, hearing
we were there, came to pay us a visit, and transferred
us to the Royal box, which is very large and comfortable&mdash;seats
twenty people easily. He sent us some ices, and
said he would have two gondolas waiting at the end of
the performance to take us through the lagoons. The
performance was a sort of ballet&mdash;very pretty girls well
got up in Venetian costume, very artistically grouped,
and quantities of colour. As soon as it was over we
went down to the "Canal," where we found two gondolas,
the real thing, with Venetian gondoliers, who were
much pleased when I spoke Italian to them. We went
all around the show, passing under the Bridge of Sighs,
and finally wound up at a Neapolitan caf&eacute;, where they
were playing and singing all the well-known Italian
songs, "Santa Lucia," "Bella Napoli," etc. Florian of
course found a friend, one of the singers, who recognised
him, having seen him in Rome when she was singing
there; so of course we all fraternised, and we stayed
there some time listening to all the familiar songs and
accompaniment of guitar and mandoline. We had quite
the impression of having spent our evening in Italy. W.
was much amused when we told him of Florian's "connaissance,"
as he always says he knows more people than
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_344" title="pg 344"> </a>
anyone he has ever seen, and is related to half France.
He is always going to some cousin's funeral in Paris.
French people are so particular about funerals&mdash;never
fail to pay that last respect to their dead friends; also
wear mourning much more than we do. They are constantly
in real mourning (not merely fancy black) for
three weeks or a month, for a very distant cousin.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Albert Gate</span>,<br >
Monday, March 9, 1892.</p>

<p>It is cold and snowing, not a very pleasant day for
our excursion to Herkomer's studio, in the country; however,
I had a line from Hilda saying they were quite
willing to go if I didn't mind the weather, so I consulted
with Lecomte, one of the secretaries who was going with
us, and we thought we would go. It would be very difficult
for me to find another day, as London is filling up
for its avant-saison, and we have quantities of engagements.
We met the Deichmanns at the station, and there
discovered that we had 40 minutes to wait, so we breakfasted
there in the big dining-room, and it wasn't bad
at all. Deichmann knows everybody and is well known
at Euston&mdash;so thanks to him we had a really excellent
breakfast (and it turned out very well, as we only got
to Herkomer's for tea, and we should have been half
starved). We had about three-quarters of an hour by rail
to our destination, Bushey, in the county of Herts. It
was bright and beautiful when we got to the station, but
the trees were white with frost and snow everywhere.
We found our host in a temporary installation. He is
building himself an enormous castle, and all the work,
stone-cutting, wood-carving, painting, etc., is done on the
spot by his pupils, Herkomer himself superintending and
directing everything. He is most interesting; full of all
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_345" title="pg 345"> </a>
sorts of knowledge and fancies. We went over the studios
and saw everything. Some dull red wood they were
using came from America he told me&mdash;I forget the
name of the tree, I think a Californian. It would have
amused you to see the eager, intelligent faces of the
young workmen, especially when Herkomer was going
about explaining his ideas and criticising or encouraging.
It reminded me rather of an evening at Wilhelmj's (the
great violinist) long ago in Germany. He had a villa
near my sister-in-law's, Mdme. Charles de Bunsen, at
Mosbach, near Biebrich-am-Rhein. We all went over
there one night to a musical party when I was staying
with my sister. His house was most artistically arranged,
all "Alt Deutsch," with an enormous music-room.
He was waiting for us there surrounded by all
his pupils, about 10, with their violins and music-stands,
and all looking so eager and anxious to begin. He
played himself quite beautifully, and when he was accompanied
by all the others it was a very pretty sight, he in
the middle and all the young ones around him with their
eyes fixed on him. He was one of Wagner's right-hand
men and played often with him. They played among
other things the prelude of "Parsifal," which haunted
me for days afterward. You can't imagine anything
more divine than those beautiful long notes of his and
the soft arpeggio accompaniments of the violins. I
couldn't hear anything else afterward. Someone asked
him to play Schubert's "Ave Maria," which he did of
course beautifully, but it sounded so tame after the other,
which I told him; but he said I was quite wrong, that
Schubert had written beautiful things, so melodious. All
the same, I would have preferred remaining with the
impression of that wonderful prelude. What reminded
me of all this was the same sort of cadre&mdash;"Ma&icirc;tre et
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_346" title="pg 346"> </a>
apprentis," for Herkomer is quite the old-fashioned embodiment
of the "Master" with his pupils. We had tea
in the studio, where there were some fine portraits. I
think I like his men better than his women. It is so difficult
to make an interesting picture of a man in ordinary
everyday dress. Herkomer has certainly succeeded in
making some wonderful pictures, without uniform, or
costume, or colour of any kind to appeal to the imagination.
We got back late for dinner. I was rather tired
and cold after my long day&mdash;we had started early, and I
persuaded W. with some difficulty to go to Lord Salisbury's
reception without me. However, he rather enjoyed
himself. He didn't get much farther than the
door, where he remained talking with Lady Salisbury,
which he always likes. I don't think he was away more
than an hour.</p>

<p>We had a nice canter this morning. There were a
good many people out. We had a pleasant dinner last
night at Lady Winifred Gardner's, one of those curious
mixtures one only sees in London. The Brownlows,
Lord Carrington, Mr. and Mrs. Gladstone, Hare the
actor and his wife, also various stray men. I found Mr.
and Mrs. Gladstone both much changed&mdash;much older&mdash;but
he is marvellous&mdash;talked, eat, and drank like a man
of 50. Hare talked a great deal, and a great deal to W.,
who found him clever and original.</p>

<p class="author">Wednesday, 30th.</p>

<p>Well, my Dear, I opened my bazaar yesterday, and you
will be surprised to hear that I was rather nervous&mdash;only
for one moment, I must say, when they asked me, after
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_347" title="pg 347"> </a>
one or two speeches and a little "Marseillaise," if I would
pronounce the sacramental phrase and declare the bazaar
open. I, with the committee, was seated in a red chair
on the platform. When I got up (the only person standing)
and saw the crowd of faces beneath me looking
hard at me, for a moment I was shy, but that didn't last.
They all cheered me, so I recovered myself and made my
statement, I think in a clear voice. W. jibed at me well
afterward when I told him. I made a tour of the bazaar,
buying something at each stall, Lecomte bringing up the
rear, carrying a large doll. Do you remember what Lasteyrie
used to say when he was W.'s Chef de Cabinet at
l'Instruction Publique&mdash;that one of his principal functions
was to accompany Madame Waddington to all the
"Ventes de Charit&eacute;" carrying a "paquet de chemises de
femme," which means that I get so tired of all the fancy
boxes, and pin-cushions, and screens I accumulate at the
various sales that I finally asked for "layettes" and "v&ecirc;tements
de pauvres." Of course I can never have too
many in the country. I was amused to hear one of my
friends here who collects for the numerous "guilds" dilate
upon the <em>smallness</em> of the objects sent her. She says
she receives dresses and "brassi&egrave;res" (a sort of body
with sleeves) that would go on <em>no</em> child of any age that
she has ever seen. It is rather my own experience&mdash;people
usually give me very minute garments, also in the
most delicate colours, and my children work in the fields
and at the "tourbi&egrave;res."</p>

<p>After we had visited all the stalls we had tea (not in
a private room) at a round table at one end of the hall
near the buffet. M. Dupoutet de la Harpe, the Protestant
pasteur who got up the bazaar, explaining that the
people would so like to see us. I am always very dressy
on those occasions, so I was dressed in black satin with
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_348" title="pg 348"> </a>
a great deal of jet, and light blue feathers in my bonnet.
I had just time to get home, have some tea, and see that
my "orgue Mustel" had arrived and was properly placed
and tuned to go with the piano, and to assist at a small
rehearsal with M. Guillemain (organist at La Trinit&eacute;
in Paris), for whom I am having a dinner to-night, M&eacute;rindol,
and Miss Stuart, an American girl who has a fine
voice. The "orgue Mustel" is small and looks like a
harmonium, but it has wonderful tones, particularly
when played by a master hand like Guillemain's.</p>

<p>My dinner interested <em>me</em> very much&mdash;I hope the guests
had the same impression. I called it my "dinner of organists,"
and I tried to get as many of the great English
organists as possible, but only two came (the notice was
short), Dr. Stainer of St. Paul's and Dr. Bridge of
Westminster Abbey. Both have splendid instruments,
and it is a great pleasure to stay sometimes after a week-day
service and hear a fugue rolling through those great
vaulted aisles. I had only asked musical people, and
warned them that it was <em>serious</em>. We were 24 at dinner,
and about 100 in the evening. The music was in the
ballroom and the organ sounded very well, quite a volume
of sound. Guillemain played, of course, beautifully
and made it give all it could. The duos, organ and piano,
were charming. Miss Stuart sang very well. I found
Dr. Bridge most sympathetic. He and Florence Williams
made great friends, and he promised to play her a
gavotte whenever she likes if she would dance. I think
you would have liked the evening&mdash;it wasn't banal. Staal
was sympathetic and interested, and asked me what was
the next original entertainment I was contemplating.</p>

<p>We have rather a worrying letter from Henrietta this
morning saying their house in Paris was watched by the
police, having been threatened by the dynamiters on account
of a judge who lives in the house. All the locataires
are leaving, and she is bothered, and wants to
know what she must do with Francis (who always goes
to her Thursday and Sunday). I want W. to write to
the Pr&eacute;fet de Police to ask for an extra man, but he
doesn't seem to attach importance to it&mdash;says no harm
ever comes when a thing is announced beforehand. I
can't help feeling uncomfortable.</p>

<p>It is rather nice to-day. After breakfast we drove
down to Battersea Park, not a very fashionable resort,
and walked about along the river, which is always alive&mdash;boats,
barges, steamers, children in battered old scows
that look as if they would break in two on the smallest
provocation, and loungers of all kinds, some fishing,
most doing nothing and keeping up a running fire of chaff
and criticisms. The river life plays a great part in London&mdash;the
Thames is such a thoroughfare all about London,
and a beautiful pleasure ground higher up by Maidenhead,
Clieveden, etc. We dined this evening at Lady
Mary Lloyd's. She sang very well after dinner, and
we went later to Lady Ashburton's, who has a beautiful
house crammed with pictures and curios of all kinds.
She had a concert of "old music" with old instruments&mdash;spinet,
viola, viol d'amour, etc. It was interesting in
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_350" title="pg 350"> </a>
its way as a souvenir, but sounded weak and <em>tinkly</em>. In
these days of great orchestras no one would listen to it.</p>

<p class="author">Easter Tuesday, April 19, 1892.</p>

<p>I am delighted to have Henrietta and Francis, the
boy's first holidays since he has been in Paris, and he is
enjoying himself extremely. He rides with his father
every morning, and goes about all day with his friends.
We are busy getting up a "toy symphony"&mdash;Mlle. Levisohn,
Francis's piano mistress, organises it. Francis has
the piano, Comte Vinci, our Roman friend (who plays
extremely well), is first violin; a little boy, a friend of
Mlle. Levisohn's, the 2nd, and the minor instruments are
distributed among all the children, Edwardes, Lawrence,
Billes, Deichmann, etc. We gave young Bille, son of
the Danish Minister, the drum&mdash;but the unfortunate boy
could do nothing with it, and his mother said he must
have some lessons. I applied to Pontavice (our Military
Attach&eacute;), who said he was sure one of his friends, an
officer in the Guards, would arrange it for me, so accordingly
there appeared one morning a gentleman (Mr.
Lloyd, I think) who said his friend, Comte de Pontavice,
had told him that I wished to have some lessons on the
drum, and that the drum-major of the regiment was
quite at my service. I hastily explained that the lessons
were not for me, but for a young friend who was to
play that instrument in a toy symphony. He didn't
seem at all surprised at my wishing to learn to play the
drum, and yet I can't help thinking that he hadn't often
been applied to for lessons on the drum for an Ambassadress.
He promised to send his man to the Danish
Legation, and Mdme. de Bille told me that all the
household was upset, and the maids distracted by the
magnificent drum-major who came three or four times,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_351" title="pg 351"> </a>
and retired to a sort of basement, where he and the boy
rattled away on the drum. If I had ever imagined what
an undertaking it was, I never should have agreed to
the performance. The principal instruments, piano and
violins, were all right, but all the small ones, quails,
nightingales, and cuckoos (oh, the cuckoos!) were something
awful. The children distracted (sometimes they
had 25 measures to count), the mammas and governesses
equally so, and the impartial assistants (who had no children
taking part) remarking to me with absolute frankness
that it was the most awful noise they had ever heard.
Comte Vinci, first violin, was a tower of strength, and
kept them all in order. It is awfully good of him to come
and play with all those children.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, April 22, 1892.</p>

<p>I will write you about the performance at once, as I
am too tired to do anything else, and have dined quietly
at home. We had a last r&eacute;p&eacute;tition this morning&mdash;Mlle.
Levisohn directing from a small platform covered with
red cloth. For the first time I thought it would go&mdash;really
almost all the instruments were in tune and in
time. Francis had been giving private rehearsals all the
morning to Wilhelm Deichmann (trumpet) and the
child, I forget which one, that had the triangle. The
performance began at 4, and the orchestra was most
effective. All the young ladies were in white and the
men in dress clothes and white boutonni&egrave;res. It was
killing to see all eyes fixed upon Mlle. Levisohn as she
stood on her platform with her baton raised. It really
went extremely well. Pfeffer happened in, and said he
had never heard the Romberg Symphony better given.
After the music was over Francis and Hilda Deichmann
played a little comedy, "La Souris," really very well&mdash;Mdme.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_352" title="pg 352"> </a>
Th&eacute;nard had coached them both. They weren't
at all shy, and looked funny perched on chairs, standing,
afraid of an imaginary mouse. They wound up with a
dance, Gevers leading a most spirited cotillon. Francis
danced with Nannie, who looked very pretty. He was
very proud of his American cousin. Mlle. Levisohn had
many compliments, and I think she was pleased. She
certainly took no end of trouble.</p>

<p>I had a nice ride this morning with Pontavice. W.
and Francis went off on Monday&mdash;W. to Laon and
Francis to school. Last night Henrietta and I went to
the Italian Embassy, where there was a contract party
for Tornielli's niece, who is to marry the Marquis Paulucci,
one of the secretaries. The fianc&eacute;e looked charming
in pink satin, with a very pretty diamond tiara that
her uncle had given her. There were a great many
people. I had the Camerons with me&mdash;Nannie looking
very pretty and chic in red satin with gold wings in
her hair. I told her the dress was much too old and
heavy for her, she should have been in white tulle, with
nothing in her hair, but she says all the American girls
wear satin. The Tornielli entertainments are always
handsome; their full dress livery red is so effective.
Henrietta and I have been driving about shopping. I
never go near a shop alone, but Mrs. Edwardes told us
there were wonderful "occasions" for silks at Marshall
&amp; Snelgrove's. We did pick up several things not dear.
The English shops are not at all like the French ones.</p>

<p>It is very cold to-day, and I think generally is on the
1st of May. One can't imagine a Queen of the May,
crowned with flowers, dancing around a May-Pole. We
are rather shivering, with a good fire in the room. It is
true that we have been sitting for some time at the window
looking at the crowds of people pouring into the
Park for their great demonstration (anti-capitalist). It
seems to be all going quite quietly&mdash;there are processions,
and banners, and brass bands (such horrors), the usual
thing, and I am sure there will be no row and that nothing
will happen&mdash;nothing ever does happen in England.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army are also holding their service in
the Park, so near that we can almost hear the hymns.
There are always soldiers hovering near when they have
their service; I wonder if it does any good. When we
were at Dover last year I went quite often to their service&mdash;they
had one almost every afternoon, late, on the
beach. It was a curious sight, such a motley crowd,
rugged old fishermen, boys (half water rats), women,
children, and occasionally a well-dressed, prosperous
small tradesman, often soldiers&mdash;some lounging on the
outskirts of the little circle, some sitting on boats, some
reverent, some merely curious, but all joining in the
hymns. I must say it interested me very much; not the
sermon, nor the preachers as a general thing, but the little
earnest group gathered on the sands with the swash of
the waves for an accompaniment, and the red coats of
the soldiers making a patch of colour. Some of the
women looked pretty even in their regulation poke-bonnets.</p>

<p>It is a beautiful, fine day. I did not perform the Drawing-room,
but walked about in the crowd with Pontavice,
which was decidedly amusing. We saw a good
many people we knew in the carriages and talked to some
of them. Very tired they looked, having been for hours
in the string. I wanted too to see some of the handsome
English turn-outs, as when we go ourselves we hardly
see anything but colleagues. The policeman, who knew
us, let us stand where we liked&mdash;I told him to stop the
French Ambassador's carriage when it came out. He
did, and I jumped in, much to the astonishment of the
crowd. We had a pleasant dinner at Lady Delamere's.
About the middle the electric light went out and we sat
for a few minutes in perfect darkness, except for a succession
of matches that Lord Wimborne, who was next
to me, lit. The servants lost their heads, and didn't think
at first of lighting candles which were on the table. It
only lasted those few minutes. Of course such accidents
will happen perpetually until the system is perfected and
universally applied.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, May 20th.</p>

<p>We had a pleasant dinner to-night at Lord Tweedmouth's
and I went afterward to a very handsome ball
at the Burtons' with Nannie and Pontavice. They have
Chesterfield House&mdash;one of the best London houses&mdash;flowers
and electric light everywhere, and such splendid
pictures. All the smart women in London were there,
and all with their tiaras, except one, who explained to me
that tiaras should only be worn at Embassies, or when
one was invited to meet Royalties, "which of course you
understand, as you haven't put yours on"&mdash;so I didn't
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_355" title="pg 355"> </a>
tell the reason, which was that I had forgotten mine,
I so rarely wear anything in my hair, and a tiara is
heavy; also I have to be "recoiff&eacute;e," which I hate. My
hair is done in the morning, and walks or rides all day,
and is merely pulled out a little at night.</p>

<p class="author">Saturday, May 21, 1892.</p>

<p>We dined to-night at the Trevelyans, all Conservatives.
The Stanleys (African Stanley) were there. He
looks as hard as steel, but I suppose couldn't do what he
has done if he were not. Many say he wants to be an
M.P. and is sure of his election. His wife can help him
enormously. It is so curious to me to see all the women
occupying themselves so energetically with politics. They
go about the country canvassing for their husbands; wear
the colours of the party; and have affiches sometimes in
their windows. I saw one well-known political woman
in London who had large bills posted on her window,
"Vote for Lord R." We should be hooted in France if
we did that sort of thing. My husband has been candidate
very often, for many offices, but I have scarcely seen
his name at the bottom of a circular and never heard him
address a public meeting of any kind&mdash;in fact, have never
been in the country when the elections were going on. It
is rather curious, as women have such a strong position
in France&mdash;a m&egrave;re de famille, and above all a grandmother,
is somebody. A clever, strong-minded grandmother
is a power in her family and immediate circle.</p>

<p>We had a funny experience to-night. We had been
engaged for some time to dine with the Gladstones, to
meet the Archbishop of Canterbury and Mrs. Benson.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_356" title="pg 356"> </a>
Mrs. Gladstone wrote to me yesterday, asking me to
come punctually at 7.45, as the Archbishop didn't like
late hours (he is rather a delicate man) and had asked
to dine early. We made a great effort to get there in
time&mdash;and <em>did</em>; so did everybody else&mdash;except the Bensons.
We waited one hour&mdash;then went to dinner (they
had sent a messenger to Lambeth and the answer came
back that the Archbishop and Mrs. Benson had started
<em>hours</em> ago. Everyone was worried and feared there must
have been an accident. At 9.30 o'clock, when dinner was
practically over (we had got to the jellies and ices), a
message was brought to Mr. Gladstone. He left the
room and reappeared with the Bensons. The explanation
was that Mrs. Gladstone had written her invitation
from Dollis Hill, a place belonging to Lord Aberdeen,
some miles out of London. They often stay there, so the
Archbishop naturally imagined he was to dine there, and
they had been driving about in the country. The poor
old lady was dreadfully put out&mdash;"The Archbishop might
have known that we were in London." Of course the
dinner was all brought back and our evening was long.
However, we managed to go for a moment to the Foreign
Office. I said to Lady Salisbury I hoped it wasn't
the last time we were supping with her at the Foreign
Office (everyone says the Liberals are coming in again).
"Will you think me very rude if I say I hope so, though
of course I shall always want to see my friends in Arlington
Street" (their private residence). I think she and
Lord Salisbury are both tired and will be glad to have
a rest, not that they will <em>socially</em>, for they are always
receiving, both in London and at Hatfield. We got home
fairly early, though the streets were crowded, Piccadilly
something awful. It is a regular London night&mdash;carriages
rolling in every direction, and all the world dining,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_357" title="pg 357"> </a>
dancing, supping. W. was rather funny over the dinner
and the long wait, but said that if he had been in Benson's
place he would have gone straight home from
Dollis Hill, and had a cup of tea in his library.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, July 2, 1892.</p>

<p>We had a small luncheon party this morning to hear
the band of the Garde R&eacute;publicaine, who have come
over from Paris for a few days to the Exhibition. They
play magnificently&mdash;we have been to hear them once or
twice and I assure you when they play the "Marseillaise"
it makes one's pulses leap. We had the Duke of Cambridge,
Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Staals, Coventrys,
etc. They played on the terrace&mdash;we had draped
the balcony with red stuffs, and had some flowers and
plants and about 70 chairs on the terrace. The Duke
talked a great deal. As soon as luncheon was over he
went straight to the library, which opens on the terrace.
We presented the Chef-de-Musique, and they played at
once a few bars of "God Save the Queen"; then the
"Marseillaise," everyone standing. Someone said to the
Duke, "It is very fine, but not an anthem like our 'God
Save the Queen.'" "Non," he answered, "mais c'est un
magnifique chant de guerre." They played for about an
hour, people coming and going and standing about on the
terrace. Some of our friends passing couldn't imagine
what was going on&mdash;there was quite a crowd collected in
the Park listening. My dress hadn't come from Paris,
so I wore white, trimmed with Valenciennes; I thought
a little of wearing a tiny tricolour bow, but didn't after
all. One of the prettiest women there was Mrs. Astor,
in black, with a big black picture hat.</p>

<p>We came down here yesterday and hoped (at least I
did) to have a lovely day on the water. Lord Dufferin
is a great yachtsman and cruises all about in his own
little boat. At the present moment it is pouring&mdash;I can
hardly see the sea&mdash;every now and then comes a partial
break and I get a glimpse of a great grey expanse of
water. We got down for dinner last night; a small party,
as there are not many bedrooms&mdash;Lord and Lady Wantage
(he such a nice man, one of the few Englishmen who
has the "L&eacute;gion d'Honneur," which he got in the Crimean
War), the Marchesa Chigi from Rome, and various
young men. The dinner was handsome&mdash;Lord Dufferin
always a charming host&mdash;and we finished the evening in
the big drawing-room, where I always feel as if I were
in the cabin of a ship, it is so directly on the water. It
looks exactly as it did in Lady Granville's time, and in
fact Lady D. told me she had not changed anything.
When I went to the drawing-room this morning I found
the three ladies talking and trying to persuade themselves
that it would clear after lunch. I said I did not mind
weather and could not stay in the house all day, so we
agreed to equip ourselves suitably and go for a walk
after lunch. In the meantime Lady D. took me over the
house&mdash;we went to see Wellington's room (where he
died). His little camp-bed is still there, and some interesting
relics, bits of uniform, and one or two letters
framed and hung upon the wall. The room is small, in
one of the towers, nothing magnificent or ducal about it.
In fact the whole house is simple and not large, one good
drawing-room, looking straight out to sea, so that sitting
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_359" title="pg 359"> </a>
inside you see the big ships pass apparently close under
the windows&mdash;a fair dining-room, no library or billiard-room,
and a few bedrooms&mdash;an ideal place for a <em>water</em>
life. The moat has been changed into a garden and there
is a tennis-court somewhere, though I didn't exactly make
out where. We went for a walk along the sea wall with
waterproofs and umbrellas, and I wondered if we should
be blown over into the sea, the wind came in such violent
gusts sometimes. It seems a child and a perambulator
were blown off the other day, and strange to say nothing
was hurt, neither child nor perambulator&mdash;only the nurse
had hysterics. We walked to Deal and paid Lady Herschell
a visit. I rather demurred at going in, as my hair
was decidedly ruffled and I was very wet, but they all
wanted to and I didn't look any worse than any of the
others. The Castle is fine, interesting&mdash;not so large as
Walmer, but with always the same beautiful situation
close to the sea. It is one of the Cinque Ports, and Lord
Sydney had it as long as he lived. The Herschells walked
back with us, and coming home was pleasanter, as the
rain had stopped and the wind diminished a little. I
came up after tea, as I was a little tired and thought I
would take advantage of a quiet moment to write to you.
I will finish to-night, as we have come upstairs early.
We had rather an amusing evening. The young people
proposed playing "Historical Portraits," and insisted
upon our all taking part. I protested vehemently, as I
never have drawn anything in my life. I remember the
drawing class years ago at Mrs. Ward's, when we all
copied a Greek girl with an amphora on her head, and
the tears I shed over my performance. The amphora
(that might have been anything) was crooked and toppling
over, and all her arms and legs were of different
lengths. Even the drawing master was obliged to say
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_360" title="pg 360"> </a>
I had no facility with my pencil. The game is really an
undertaking. Everyone is given paper and pencils and
you have 5 minutes by the watch to draw a historical
portrait or portraits. My neighbour, one of the sons,
was doing something most elaborate&mdash;a quantity of figures&mdash;my
other neighbour, about my calibre, looked
helpless, but said she must do something. What do you
think she did? "The House that Jack Built," an infantine
production with 4 lines and a chimney, the sort
of thing that we all have done as children. That gave me
courage, particularly as she had played the game before,
and knew what could be received, so I drew the "Man
in the Moon." Can't you see it&mdash;a large, round O with
dots for eyes, nose, and mouth. Some of the drawings
were really very clever&mdash;the "Field of the Cloth of Gold"
with a great many figures, and Raleigh and his cloak
before Elizabeth; Queen Elizabeth with a chignon and a
short bicycle skirt. We amused ourselves very much.
We leave to-morrow morning, W. by the first train, as
he had an early rendezvous in London. I shall go a little
later with the Wantages.</p>

<p>W. and I drove out to Lyon House this afternoon to
a garden party at the Duke of Northumberland's. It is
a fine old place, about an hour's drive from London, with
big iron gates, with the Percy lion with its tail straight
out on top. The Duke did not appear&mdash;his daughter-in-law,
Countess Percy (who is a daughter of the Duke of
Argyll) did the honours. She showed us the great corridor
and large drawing-room with a fine Adam's ceiling,
and then we went out into the garden, where there were
quantities of tents, carpets, tea-tables&mdash;and half London.
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_361" title="pg 361"> </a>
Everyone was talking elections. I sympathised with
Philip Stanhope, who has been beaten, and said, "Why
didn't you spend more money while you were about it?"
He was not in the least outraged at such a question, and
replied promptly, "I should have certainly, if I hadn't
been so sure of being named." They say a great deal of
money has been spent this time.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">London</span>, July 27th.</p>

<p>We had our last outing for this year last night; a
handsome dinner at Tornielli's for the Duc d'Aoste.
He is a tall, good-looking young fellow, decidedly dashing,
and inclined to amuse himself. He is a curious contrast
to his father, whom I liked extremely, but who was
cold and silent, looked like a Spanish grandee of the
Middle Ages, or a soldier-monk&mdash;a very striking face
and figure. Countess Somaglia (n&eacute;e Gwendoline Doria)
was among the guests, with her two daughters. We
talked a little of old days in Rome. I remember so well
when she was married.</p>

<p>To-morrow I shall make our paquets, and we four,
Francis and I, May and Beatrice, leave for Bayreuth and
the Tyrol by the Club train on Saturday. I ordered my
mountain dresses at Nicoll's&mdash;two skirts to one jacket&mdash;a
real short one faced with leather for mountaineering,
and a longer one, shortish too, for travelling, in blue
serge; a shortish blue linen, and an alpaca. All the
personnel dine to-night for good-bye. This is my 9th
season in London&mdash;I wonder if I shall ever see it again.
I have a presentiment that next year we shall only go
back to take leave.</p>

<p>We came over last night; a very good crossing, the
shortest I ever made; we were just one hour on the boat.
Lady Salisbury was on board, coming from the Riviera.
We talked all the way over. She is very sorry we are
going&mdash;says the Queen will regret M. Waddington very
much; that she had great confidence in him, and now, at
her age, rather dreads seeing strange faces around her.
W. is very glad to get back to France&mdash;I too. After all,
ten years is a long time to be away from one's country.</p>

<p class="author">Sunday, 5th.</p>

<p>W. and I drove out this afternoon to White Lodge to
say good-bye to Princess Mary. As we came quite near
to the house we crossed very quickly two gentlemen in
a hansom and just recognised the Prince of Wales and
Prince George. Everyone is saying that that marriage
will be arranged. Princess Mary and Princess May were
alone, and decidedly more cheerful. Princess May still
in black, but with no cr&ecirc;pe and a little jet. Princess
Mary was charming and friendly as she always is, and
seemed really sorry we were going, also wanted to know
who was coming in our place; but that I couldn't tell her.
She promised to come to tea one afternoon at the Embassy
before we went away. Various people came in to
tea, as they always do here on Sunday afternoon, and
someone said the marriage was certainly decided and
would be announced after the 27th, which was to have
been the wedding-day last year. They certainly looked
much brighter and happier than I expected to see them.</p>

<p>I went this afternoon to the House of Commons to
hear Mr. Gladstone make his great Irish speech. I had
an excellent place in the front row of the ladies' gallery,
and heard and saw everything. The House was packed,
chairs all along the gangway&mdash;the Prince, Dukes of
York and Teck in their places, quantities of peers and
some diplomats&mdash;no Ambassadors, which surprised me.
I know that W. always prefers reading a speech the next
day, but I thought some of the others would be there.
Mr. Gladstone was much cheered by both sides when he
came in (a tribute to his age and intelligence rather than
to his politics). He rose to speak at a quarter to 4, finishing
at 5 minutes past six (two hours and 20 minutes).
He was much quieter and less passionate than I had expected.
There was no vehement appeal for the wrongs
of Ireland. It was more an "expos&eacute; de motifs" than a
real speech, but it was an extraordinary effort for a man
of his age (83). His voice was so clear and strong,
never faltering: a little weaker and lower perhaps toward
the end. I suppose it is the last great political speech he
will ever make.</p>

<p>We are beginning our tourn&eacute;e of farewell visits, and
to-day we have been to take leave of the Prince and Princess
of Wales at Marlborough House. I had not seen
the Princess since Prince Eddie's death. I wore blue
velvet and my Jubilee medal. We were received at the
door by all the household&mdash;Probyn, Lord Suffield, Stanley
Clark, Lady Suffield, and Miss Knollys. Prince
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_364" title="pg 364"> </a>
George was in the first drawing-room. The Prince and
Princess with two daughters in the big long room. I
can't say I found the Princess changed or grown older.
She looked sad, but it was the same slight, youthful
figure. She was still in deep plain black (woollen stuff)
with no ornaments. She was charming, with the sweet,
simple manner she always has. Tears came into her
eyes when she said she hadn't seen me for so long on
account of her mourning. I asked her about her first
grandchild&mdash;Princess Louise Fife's little girl. She said
she was a dear little thing, talked a great deal, trotted
about everywhere, and called her "Granny." W. and the
Prince talked together, but we didn't stay very long. I
didn't say a word to the Princess about Prince Eddie
(they told me not to), only just as we were going I said
I hoped the end of the year would bring her happiness
and blessing. She squeezed my hand, but her lips quivered
and she couldn't speak. She has been unfailing to
us always and said we should certainly meet again, and
that I must always let her know when I came to England.
I begin to realise now that we are going, with all these
leave-takings. After all we have been here 10 years, and
that is a good piece out of one's life.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Albert Gate</span>,<br >

<p>I wish you had been here yesterday to see the farewell
dinner for W. at the Mansion House. It was a great
tribute to a departing Ambassador&mdash;all the distinguished
men in England assembled to say good-bye. The Lady
Mayoress had asked me to dine with her and bring anyone
I wanted, so I took Hilda and Mdme. de la Villestreux.
Hilda and I started together a little before 7.
As we drew near the Mansion House there was quite
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_365" title="pg 365"> </a>
a crowd; quantities of policemen, and empty carriages
driving away. We went in by the same entrance as the
men, and then turned off sharp to the right and were
conducted to the drawing-room of the Lady Mayoress.
I wore black moir&eacute; with a great band of orange velvet
on the corsage, and all the jewels I possessed&mdash;tiara,
pearls, and diamond necklace and diamond stars and
ornaments fastened on the front of the dress, as I knew
we were to sit in the gallery after dinner to hear the
speeches. We found Mdme. de la Villestreux already
there&mdash;there were 16 women. The Lady Mayoress presented
them all to me. They were all ex-Lady Mayoresses&mdash;"ladies
who had passed the chair," which it seems
is the technical term. She also gave me a splendid bouquet
tied with a tricolour ribbon. The dinner was very
good, the traditional London public dinner menu&mdash;turtle
soup, salmon, etc. There was very handsome silver on
the table: great massive bowls and flagons and beautiful
flowers&mdash;very quickly served, and really very pleasant.
After the first five minutes everyone talked. Some of the
women were handsome, all well dressed and with quantities
of diamonds. Just as we were finishing a servant
came to summon us to the gallery. The loving cup was
going round and the speeches were to begin. The Lady
Mayoress led the way to the gallery in the great banqueting
hall directly opposite the table d'honneur. It was
a striking sight, particularly that table where was the
Lord Mayor in his robes, and all the diplomatists with
stars and broad ribbons. There was a blaze of light and
at first I couldn't recognise anyone (we were very high),
and then I saw W. standing, drinking out of the loving
cup, with the Lord Mayor on one side and Rustem on the
other, and gradually I made out a good many people.
There were two long tables besides the table d'honneur,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_366" title="pg 366"> </a>
and they told me about 300 guests. All the representative
men and intelligence of England assembled to say
God-speed to the departing Ambassador. The Speaker
and Lord Herschell (Presidents of the two Houses) were
both there, and men of every possible coterie from Lord
Lorne to James Knowles of the "Nineteenth Century."
As soon as the regular toasts had been drunk there was
a pause and then came the toast of the evening with
"bumpers," "The French Ambassador." There were
roars of applause when W. got on his legs, and I must
confess to a decided choke in my throat. W. spoke (in
English, which they had asked him to do) very simply
and very well, going back to his early days. When he
said that he had done his best always to keep up good
and friendly relations with England, and that he had
had much sympathy from all sides, he was much cheered;
but much more when he said that perhaps what had
given him more friends in England than any of his public
acts as a statesman was the fact that he had rowed in
the University eight at Cambridge. Then there were
roars of applause, and he heard quite distinctly the people
below saying&mdash;"he is quite right, we always remember
it." He was quite &eacute;mu when he came to the end; his
voice taking that grave tone I like so much when he said
"good-bye." One heard every word. He was much
cheered when he finished. The Lady Mayoress came
and shook hands with me and asked me if I wasn't proud
of my husband. Some of the speeches were charming&mdash;the
Speaker's particularly; Lord Lorne also made a very
pretty little speech, and Rustem (Turk), who answered
the toast for the "Corps Diplomatique," made a very
good speech. I can't remember all the names and all the
speeches, but it was a most brilliant assembly, and as
Countess Deym said to me, a wonderful tribute to W. As
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_367" title="pg 367"> </a>
soon as the speeches were over we all went down to the
great hall, where I had a perfect d&eacute;fil&eacute; of compliments
and regrets, Lord Lorne again repeating his words "that
W.'s departure was a national calamity." All had something
friendly to say&mdash;the two Law Lords, Judge Bowen
and Sir Francis Jeune, most sympathetic. S. too told
me I should be much pleased&mdash;he had never seen such a
demonstration in England for a foreigner. Of course
some of the young men came in to the Embassy to talk
the dinner over, and gave their impressions. They were
all much pleased. W. certainly was, and said he felt
quite &eacute;mu when he saw all the faces turned to him
and knew that every word he said would tell&mdash;also he
knew quite well that his reference to the boat-race would
appeal much more to the <em>general</em> public than any expressions
of good feeling toward England. He hasn't always
had an easy time with his English name and his English
education. Of course it has been very useful to him
here, as he has been thrown with all sorts of people, and
could understand the English point of view, but in
France they were always afraid he was too English. I
think when he has gone they will realise at home what
good work he has done here <em>because</em> he understands them.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">French Embassy, London</span>,<br >
March 8, 1893.</p>

<p>W. and I went together to the Mansion House, Tuesday,
to pay a farewell visit to the Lady Mayoress, who
was receiving formally with music, tea, and quantities of
people. The Lord Mayor appeared too when he heard
we were there, and was quite pleased when W. said how
gratified and touched he had been by the banquet and
the universal expression of regret at his departure. The
Lord Mayor said to him, "You can't find any warmer
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_368" title="pg 368"> </a>
friends, Ambassador, in France than those you are leaving
here, but I quite understand that a man can't live
long out of his own country." We had just time to get
back to the Embassy, dress, and start for Windsor, where
we dined: our last stay in the yellow rooms. The dinner
was almost entirely Royal&mdash;the Empress Frederick,
Prince and Princess Christian, Prince and Princess
Henry of Battenberg, Duchess of Connaught, del Mazo,
the Spanish Ambassador, I the only other lady. The
cercle was not long&mdash;I thought the Queen looked tired.
She sat down at once; said she wouldn't say good-bye, as
she hoped to see me once more at Buckingham Palace.
She said at her age she rather dreaded saying good-bye,
also seeing new faces, and she was very sorry we were
going. "Who comes to replace you?" I said I thought
nothing was yet decided. I talked some time to the other
Princesses after the Queen had cong&eacute;died me. The Empress
was as usual charming, and said, "I am afraid we
sha'n't meet again often, Mdme. Waddington, you won't
cross to Berlin, and I can't go to Paris, but that isn't my
fault. I think we shall have to meet in Italy, where I
first had the pleasure of seeing you." The end of the
evening we spent as usual in the drawing-room with the
"household." I had quite a talk with Prince Henry,
who is very good-looking and attractive. We left the
drawing-room about eleven&mdash;W. going as usual to
smoke, and I to my rooms. I sat some time in front of
the fire in the beautiful little yellow drawing-room wondering
if I ever should see it again, and going back to
our first Windsor visit, when all was so new and strange
to me. I wonder where we shall be this time next year,
and if we shall settle down easily to our quiet life in
France. W. came in rather late from the smoking-room:
he said all the men were so nice to him, and seemed really
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_369" title="pg 369"> </a>
sorry he was going; also were very anxious to know if
he wasn't sorry himself.</p>

<p>This morning (Wednesday) it was beautiful. I
breakfasted as usual in my rooms and sat some time in
the deep window recess watching all the people coming
and going. There is always so much life about Windsor
when the Queen is there. About 10 Colonel Byng came
to take us to the Chapel to see the sarcophagus of Prince
Eddie, which is enormous and has rather too much
colour&mdash;almost gaudy. I went with Hilda the other day
to Gilbert's studio to see the monument he is making,
and which I liked. It is very elaborate and complicated,
but the sleeping figure good: so reposeful and young;
the long straight limbs. One quite realised a young life
cut short. Gilbert is clever and interesting, and begged
us to criticise freely.</p>

<p>We got home about 12 and I took a short turn in the
Park before breakfast, which was full as usual when the
Queen passes. She came this afternoon for two Drawing-rooms.
I shall do my last to-morrow&mdash;I sha'n't go
to the second.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">French Embassy</span>,<br >
March 10, 1893.</p>

<p>I am doing all my last things. I went to the Drawing-room
yesterday (our last). Countess Spencer presented
the ladies, and looked very stately and handsome in
black, with splendid jewels. The Queen didn't stay very
long, but looked less tired, I thought, than the other night
at Windsor. I said good-bye to a great many people
whom I sha'n't see again. At this season plenty of people
are still in the country, and only come up for a day or two
for Drawing-rooms, theatres, etc. Teesdale and I had
quiet an affectionate parting. For so long now we have
made our entr&eacute;e together into the Throne Room: he
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_370" title="pg 370"> </a>
holding my hand and both of us making a deep bow and
curtsey at the door, that we have become quite like
puppets.</p>

<p>This afternoon I have had my farewell audience from
the Queen at Buckingham Palace at 4 o'clock. I wore
as usual the blue velvet, which will walk about alone
soon, as it has done all the ceremonies lately; my pearls,
and a cr&ecirc;me velvet bonnet with light blue feathers. I
went in the ordinary open carriage (not gala). The
gala carriage with the powdered wigs, big footmen,
canes, etc., went out yesterday for the last time to the
Drawing-room. I had some difficulty in getting into
the court-yard, which was filled with carriages, luggage-vans,
soldiers, etc., as the Queen was leaving this afternoon
for Windsor. I was sent from one entrance to
another, in spite of the tricolour cockade, and finally
drew up at a side-door (where a shabby little victoria
was standing). A man in ordinary black livery appeared,
and after a short parley (in which I intervened
myself, saying that I was the French Ambassadress and
had an audience with the Queen) he showed me into a
room on the ground floor. I waited about 15 minutes
(it was 5 minutes to 4 when I arrived) and then Lady
Southampton, Lady in Waiting, appeared, with many
apologies for being late&mdash;she didn't think I would come
so soon (and I was a little afraid of being late, they kept
me so long in the court-yard). We went upstairs to a
small drawing-room looking out on the court-yard, and
in about 10 minutes the same servant in black appeared,
saying, "The Queen is ready to receive the French Ambassadress."
Lady Southampton said she couldn't come,
as the Queen wished to see me alone, so I followed the
servant down a long corridor&mdash;he stopped at a door,
knocked, a voice said "come in," and I found myself in
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_371" title="pg 371"> </a>
the Royal presence. It was a small, ordinary room,
rather like a sort of waiting-room, no traces of habitation,
nothing pretty or interesting. The Queen was
standing, very simply dressed in black (her travelling
dress she said, she was starting at once for Windsor)
before a writing-table which was in the middle of
the room, covered with books and papers. She was
most kind, made me sit down on the sofa next to her,
and said she was afraid she had kept me waiting, but
that she had been kept by a visit from Mr. Gladstone&mdash;she
then paused a moment, so I made a perfectly banal
remark, "what a wonderful man, such an extraordinary
intelligence," to which she replied, "He is very deaf."
She expressed great regret at our departure, and hoped
we were sorry to leave England and all our friends, but
after all Paris was not very far off, and she hoped she
should see me again. She was sure M. Waddington
would find plenty to do when he got back&mdash;would he
continue his literary work? I said he would certainly
have plenty to do, as he was Senator and Membre de
l'Institut, but that we should both miss the Embassy life
and the varied interests it brought. She repeated that she
hoped to see me again, so I asked if ever I came back to
England might I write to one of her ladies, and ask if I
could be received. "Pray do, and I shall not say good-bye,
but au revoir." We talked about 15 minutes about
all sorts of things&mdash;some of our colleagues&mdash;our successor,
etc. She asked again who was coming to London,
and said, "My last two Ambassadors to France were ex-Viceroys."
It seemed to me that she said it on purpose,
and that she wanted France to send one of her best men
to St. James's. I repeated the remark to my husband,
and the chancellerie. It is quite true. The present British
Ambassador, Lord Dufferin, is certainly the first
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_372" title="pg 372"> </a>
diplomatist they have. He has had every distinguished
post England can offer&mdash;Ambassador to St. Petersburg
and Rome, Governor of Canada, and Viceroy of India,
and has played a great part. His predecessor, Lord
Lytton, was also Viceroy of India, and very distinguished,
though in a different way from Lord Dufferin.
I rather fancy that Montebello would be an acceptable
appointment. He knows English well, has English relations,
and I should think would like the post, but I have
really no idea. Some of the papers say that Ribot wants
the place, but I think he prefers home politics and would
not care to leave France; however, I could not tell the
Queen anything definite. She kissed me at parting, and
gave me her photograph, signed, in a handsome silver
frame&mdash;then half turned her back, moving to a door on
the other side of the room, so that I could get out easily
and not altogether &agrave; reculons, which would have been
awkward to open the door. I tucked my parcel under
my arm, opened the door myself (a thing I don't often
do in these days, except my bedroom door) and found
myself again in the long corridor. My audience was
over, and I daresay I shall never see the Queen again.
She was unfailing to us both from the first moment, always
welcomed us with the same smile, was always inclined
to talk about anything and to understand and
smooth over any little difficulty or misunderstanding. I
think she is a wonderful woman and a wonderful Queen.
In her long life she must have had many difficult questions
and responsibilities, and certainly England has not
suffered under her rule. I met Lady S. in the corridor,
who came downstairs with me, and said she was quite
sure the Queen meant it when she said she would like
to see me again, that she <em>never</em> said anything she didn't
mean.</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_373" title="pg 373"> </a></p>

<p>I found Hilda and one or two friends when I got home
who told me that the English ladies, headed by Ladies
Salisbury and Spencer, representing the two parties,
Conservative and Liberal, were going to give me a souvenir
(in memory of my ten years in London), a jewel
of some kind. I was rather pleased. The last days of
adieux are rather melancholy. I shall be glad when they
are over. I forgot to say that Wednesday I had a message
about 3 o'clock from the Princess Beatrice, saying
she and Prince Henry of Battenberg would come about
5 and ask me for a cup of tea. The notice was so short
that I hadn't time to ask anyone except Hilda, who happened
in, and some of the secretaries. They came alone
and were most friendly&mdash;said they had not given me any
more time on purpose, as they didn't want a party, but
merely to see us. They were as easy and pleasant as
possible, she talking much more than she ever does in
the grand monde. I told her I hoped she would let me
know if ever she came to Paris. She said. "Oh, yes&mdash;and
we will do a lively play together."</p>

<p>I went this afternoon with Mdme. de la Villestreux
to the French bazaar at Kensington Town Hall to receive
Princess Mary, who opened it (and very much better
than I did the day I performed the same thing). Mdme.
de Bylandt, de Bille, Mdme. du Poutel de la Harpe were
all there waiting at the foot of the stairs. Princess Mary
was easy and charming, and I really think was not bored.
She had all the ladies presented to her, talked to them all,
knew apparently all their relations, young and old, complimented
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_374" title="pg 374"> </a>
them on the arrangement of their stalls, said
the various objects made and presented by the Ladies'
Art Association were very artistic and useful (I wish
you could have seen them&mdash;<em>our</em> pincushions at the Vente
des Diaconnesses were things of beauty next to them),
took her tea, said the cake was so good, and delighted
everybody. When I see how easy it is for Royalties to
win golden opinions with a few gracious words and a
smile, I wonder at the stiff, stand-off manner some of
them adopt. Princess May looked very slight and pretty,
and is always well dressed. I again wore the blue velvet,
which will fall off me soon, but this time I changed the
bonnet and wore a black jet one with a red rose, and it
wasn't very pretty.</p>

<p>We had a last musical afternoon to-day at Marie Humlicher's:
8 hands, two pianos, she directing and the performers
being Ctesse. de Bylandt, Mlle. de Staal, Hilda
and I. We played Mozart and Schumann, really very
well. Mlle. Humlicher has a nice big room over a coutouri&egrave;re
on Fulham Road. She always gives us tea after
the music, which is generally brought up by a tidy little
English maid with her cap and apron. She was astounded
this afternoon when the tea was brought in by a most
elegant young person, dressed in the latest fashion, and
attended by a second, also most stylish&mdash;however, as the
tea was all right she did not say anything; neither did I,
but I waited a moment after the other ladies had gone
and she had a mysterious conversation on the stairs and
came in highly amused. It seems the two elegant ladies
were the dressmaker and her assistant. When they saw
all these ambassadorial equipages at their door&mdash;enormous
powdered footmen, wigs, cockades, etc., also Hilda's
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_375" title="pg 375"> </a>
beautiful carriage (Deichmann has splendid horses
always and everything perfectly well turned out), their
curiosity got the better of them and they felt they <em>must</em>
see the swells; so they interviewed the maid, installed her
in their rooms to attend to any customer who might
come, got into their swell garments, and brought up the
tea. Wasn't it funny? Luckily we were all rather elegant.
I had been paying some farewell visits, and it so
happened that we were all up to the mark. I have sometimes
gone to Mlle. Humlicher's on foot in a cloth dress,
as it is not far from the Embassy. I am sorry to have
done with those afternoons&mdash;Mlle. Humlicher plays
beautifully&mdash;she is a pupil of Rubinstein's and has a real
artistic nature.</p>

<p>I had a line from Lady Salisbury yesterday, asking if
to-day at 5 would suit me to receive the ladies and my
present. I accepted of course, asking her about how
many would come. She answered, between 50 and 60,
she thought. As the moment drew near I got rather
nervous, for W. said they would certainly make me a
little speech and that I would have to reply, and he suggested
thinking it over; but that I refused and said I
must trust to the inspiration of the moment. I wore my
purple satin. The ladies arrived very punctually. There
were one or two men, all the personnel, including W.,
and one or two of my friends, Sir George Arthur,
Gevers, etc. Lady Salisbury asked me where I would
stand, so I put myself in the middle of the big drawing-room,
under the chandelier. Lady Salisbury was spokeswoman,
flanked on one side by Lady Spencer, the other
by Mrs. Gladstone; all the other ladies, including Ladies
Londonderry, Cadogan, Shrewsbury, Harcourt, etc.,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_376" title="pg 376"> </a>
forming a circle round me. Lady Salisbury made a very
pretty little speech, beginning&mdash;"Madame Waddington,
Ambassadress," and saying they hoped I would sometimes
think of England and my English friends, that I
had been there so long that I seemed one of themselves,
etc., and then handed me a blue velvet &eacute;tui. I don't
know exactly what I replied (I was rather &eacute;mue and W.
just opposite to me was looking at me hard), but evidently
only a few words, to say that the ten years I had
spent in London had been very happy ones, that France
wasn't very far away, and that I hoped to come back
often&mdash;but I think they understood that I was pleased
and grateful for the present, and above all with the
feeling that prompted it. The jewel is very handsome,
a circle of large, beautiful white diamonds with a large
pearl in the centre and another as pendant. It was passed
around the company and they all found it very handsome.
We had tea in the blue room, and I talked to them
all and said what was perfectly true, that they had been
ten perfectly happy years we had spent in London, and
ten years is a good piece out of one's life. They left me
a book with the names of all the "signataires." W. was
much pleased, and I fancy it was rather an unusual
demonstration. One of these days, when Francis's wife
wears it, it will be a historic jewel. After all the company
had gone the secretaries stayed on a little while.
I think they are all sorry we are going, and they certainly
regret W. as a chief. They all say he is so absolutely
just.</p>

<p>We walked about in the Row this morning. It was
cold and raw, not many people. We dined at the Italian
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_377" title="pg 377"> </a>
Embassy in the evening with Tornielli. The Comtesse
is at Naples with her niece, the young Marquise Paulucci,
who has just had a fine boy. The dinner was small,
mostly colleagues. We sat after dinner in the red drawing-room,
which is very picturesque&mdash;a fine old carved
chimney, enormous, and beautiful old red silk hangings
just faded enough to give an old-world look. He has
brought quantities of things from his palace in Italy.
Lincoln was there. He knows who his successor is&mdash;Mr.
Bayard. We don't know ours.</p>

<p>Princess Mary and Princess May had promised to
come once to tea before I left and they named to-day.
I asked very few people&mdash;Duchess of St. Albans, Ladies
Arran, Randolph Churchill, Hilda, and some men, Deym,
Tornielli, Mensdorff, George Arthur, etc. Lady Randolph
is very musical, plays extremely well and is very
kind to all the artists. I asked Mlle. Jansen (Swedish),
who sang quite beautifully&mdash;a fine voice, such a ring in
it. She is going to America, and I am sure she will have
a great success. Both Princesses were as cordial and
nice as possible, said it would seem strange not to see
me about everywhere any more. "Of course you will
come back to London," Princess Mary said; "but it can
never be the same thing&mdash;you will be a visitor; now you
are living your life with us, and London is your home."
Princess May looked very pretty, and so bright that I
fancy her engagement is settled&mdash;everyone seems to
think so. I didn't say anything to her, but when I parted
from Princess Mary at the foot of the stairs I couldn't
help saying that I heard that very soon all her friends
would be able to congratulate her, and that as I was
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_378" title="pg 378"> </a>
going I would like to think that very happy days were
before her. She said "I hope so&mdash;I think so," and kissed
me. At the door she turned and said, "I wonder when I
shall have tea and music again in these rooms. I shall
always think with pleasure of the French Embassy."
We had a farewell dinner at our cousin's, Mrs. Mostyn's.
Lord Herschell was on one side of me and talked a great
deal about the banquet at the Mansion House. He said
W.'s English was so good, too classical if anything; said
he would like very much to hear him speak in French
and at the Tribune. He couldn't imagine such a quiet
speech and manner in the fiery French Chamber. I told
him the Senate was much more sedate than the Chamber
(consequently much less amusing) and that he would
often hear a perfectly quiet academic speech there.</p>

Good Friday, March 31, 1893.</p>

<p>We went to the afternoon service at St. Paul's, where
the anthem was beautiful. There were a great many
people, a great many men following the service, and a
great many also walking about looking at the tombs and
tablets.</p>

<p>We really have not a moment these last days. I shall
go over a little before W., about the 12th of next month.
We have had all sorts of leave-takings. The Empress
Frederick received us the other day&mdash;always charming
and interesting, but still talking of her visit to Paris,
which she can't get over. She said to me, "I would have
liked so much to see you in Paris, in your own house.
M. Waddington promised me a dinner with all your
clever men." "I should have been much pleased and
honoured, Majest&eacute;; perhaps a little later he may have
that pleasure&mdash;but I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><a class="pagenum break" id="page_379" title="pg 379"> </a></p>

<p>We had all a pleasant visit to Princess Louise at Kensington,
who said she would certainly let us know when
she came to Paris&mdash;I think she often comes. We went
to White Lodge, of course, where they all look so
happy I can't help thinking that the marriage is arranged.
We also went, for a farewell cup of tea, to
Alma Tadema, who receives once a week in his beautiful
studio. He is going to send me an engraving of one
of his lovely Greek pictures. His atelier is most picturesque
and full of interesting things. He has a set of
panels painted by all his artist friends which are gems.
He is very attractive himself&mdash;so simple. There were
a good many people there.</p>

<p>We had a dinner and party (music) last week at Lady
Wimborne's. Their entertainments are always successful.
The house (Hamilton House) is one of the best in
London. Lord B., a great friend of W.'s, took me to
get an ice at the buffet, and was deploring W.'s departure.
"Such a pity that Waddington had gone back to France
after graduating so brilliantly at Cambridge. He would
certainly have made the same career in England, and
would have been Premier in England, so much better
than being Premier in France"&mdash;a truly British sentiment
(what makes their strength, perhaps), but naif.</p>

Easter Sunday, April 2, 1893.</p>

<p>My last Easter in London, a beautiful bright day.
Henrietta, Francis, and I walked down to Westminster
Abbey in the morning. It was crowded, as it always is&mdash;Easter
is such a splendid service&mdash;the fine old Easter
hymn always the same, with the Hallelujah echoing
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_380" title="pg 380"> </a>
through the vaults and arches. We had a small dinner
in the evening&mdash;Jusserand (who had come back to see
his friends, of whom he has thousands here), the La
Villestreux, the personnel, and a few young people in the
evening. I wore my jewel, which they all found very
handsome.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">French Embassy</span>,<br >
April 9th.</p>

<p>Henrietta, Francis, and I went to the Temple Church
this morning. It is a grand old place, right in the heart
of London. We were met at the door by one of the
"benchers," who gave us very good places and took us
all over the church and various halls after service. Francis
had never been there and was wildly interested, particularly
in the tombs of the old Crusaders with their
crossed legs. We lunched with quite a party of benchers
and their wives in the "parlement" room, a charming
room looking out on the river and across a garden filled
with roses, streams of sunlight pouring in at all the windows.
They told us the War of the Roses, white and
red, was planned in those gardens, and asked us if we
remembered the old lines:</p>

<ol>
<li>"If this red rose offend thy sight,</li>
  <li class="indent2">It in thy bosom wear;</li>
<li>'Twill blush to find itself less white</li>
  <li class="indent2">And turn Lancastrian there.:</li>
</ol>

<p>Yesterday we had a handsome "Diner d'Adieu" at the
Turkish Embassy, principally colleagues. Lincoln was
there&mdash;he too is going, his wife left yesterday. They
have raised the United States Legation here to an Embassy,
and I hope they will raise the salaries. No one
is more asked out or has a better position here than the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_381" title="pg 381"> </a>
United States Minister. I always remember the remark
of one of our colleagues, Baron Solvyns, who had been
long in London and knew it well. We were talking one
day about the Corps Diplomatique, small Powers, Embassies,
etc., and were discussing who was the most important
Ambassador in London. Solvyns said, "There
is no doubt about it, the American <em>Minister</em> is the first
Ambassador in London."</p>

<p>My last letter from Albert Gate, Dear. Yesterday all
our small things, silver, house linen, etc., departed. The
packing seemed well done. We put everything that was
to go in the ballroom (little Dresden figures, glasses, silver
ornaments), nothing packed, all spread out, on tables.
A man came and made an inventory, packs everything
in a great van that comes to the door and arrives at our
door in the Rue Dumont d'Urville, where equally everything
is taken out and unpacked. He says nothing will
be broken. It is certainly a very easy way of moving,
and I shall be anxious to see how they arrive. The
Florians had their furniture taken over like that, and I
think one table was a little d&eacute;mantibul&eacute;e. We leave to-morrow;
we being Henrietta and I. W. stays some little
time still. I take over all the French servants, both
coachmen, and my victoria and horses, as I must settle
myself for the spring in the Paris house. W. sends over
one of the secretaries, M. Lecomte, with us, and the colleagues
are all coming to the station to say good-bye.
The rooms look melancholy to-night, so many things
gone; piano of course and all books and small tables,
screens, etc.&mdash;all the gros mobilier belongs to the Embassy.
We sat some time talking, just we three: W.,
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_382" title="pg 382"> </a>
Henrietta, and I, after dinner. W. has just been named
one of the Directeurs du Canal de Suez. I think he will
find plenty of occupation when he gets back.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Paris, 31, Rue Dumont d'Urville,</span><br >
April 16, 1893.</p>

<p>Here I am, Dear, back in my little salon, writing at
my table in the corner by the window, and rather distracted
by the quantities of carriages passing. There
is so much more movement in the street than when we
left ten years ago, and I have got accustomed to such a
quiet bedroom and salon. All our living rooms (except
the dining-room) at Albert Gate gave on the Park, so
we never heard the rattle and noise of carriages over
pavements, and as no cabs nor camions are allowed in
the Park the passing never disturbed us. We came over
very comfortably on Thursday. All our colleagues were
at the station to see us off, and I think they are sorry
to say good-bye. We found our voiture-salon filled with
flowers. Sir George Arthur and S. came over with us.
It was very cold and very rough. All the men disappeared
at once, but Henrietta and I remained on deck
and were quite happy, well wrapped up with rugs, and
tarpaulins stretched in front of us to keep out the wet.
Lecomte had arranged our lunch in the private room of
the buffet at Calais (where W. and I always breakfasted
when we came over) and it was comfortable to see a
bright fire. I am ashamed to say that the ladies of the
party eat a very good breakfast. The men looked rather
white, and certainly were not good "fourchettes" at
that meal. At Dover we had found Lord William Seymour
in uniform, with his aide-de-camp, wife and daughter
waiting for us. He took me on the boat, and to the
cabin, where there were more flowers, and stayed until
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_383" title="pg 383"> </a>
the last moment, giving the captain all manner of instructions
for my comfort, and particularly to see that my
cabin was warm, with plenty of rugs, etc. I never went
near it. I think Adela&iuml;de and Bonny had a very comfortable
time there. Francis met us at the Gare du Nord,
much pleased to have us back. We went to Henrietta's
to dine. I was glad to come home directly after dinner
and go to bed. Well, Dear, there is one chapter of my
life closed&mdash;I wonder what the future reserves for us.
I shall be uncomfortable for a few days until my van
arrives. It left the same day we did, and the man said
it would take a week to bring the things over, but I shall
not expect them for ten days. I found quantities of cards
and notes here, and Louise and Henrietta of course will
give me dinner or anything else I want until I can get
quite settled. Hubert got over only to-day. The sea
was so rough he wouldn't cross on Thursday; he waited
a day at Folkestone, and another at Boulogne, to rest the
horses which had been knocked about. W. writes that
the Embassy seems absolutely empty. Still he dines out
every night (at the club when he hasn't an invitation)
and will come over as soon as he can. The house looks
so small after the big rooms at Albert Gate, and the
stable and little cour minute. It sounded so familiar to
hear the carriage coming in under the vo&ucirc;te, and also
the street cries. I daresay in a few days I shall take
up my ordinary Paris life, and London will seem a
dream&mdash;like Moscow.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Bayreuth</span>,<br >
Saturday, July 31, 1897.<sup><a href="#fn12" id="r12">[12]</a></sup></p>

<p>We arrived Thursday evening from Nuremberg in a
pouring rain, which continued all day Friday, and detestable
it was&mdash;streets crowded, everybody's umbrella running
into one and catching in your veil (really twice in
mine), mud everywhere, carriages scarce and dear. Our
rooms are comfortable, Mary de Bunsen got them for
us, a good-sized salon (with a piano), three bedrooms,
and two maids' rooms. We have our early breakfast
and supper, but dine out. Our experience at the Sonne
was not very agreeable&mdash;a long, hot dining-room, quantities
of hungry people and no servants to speak of. I
was rather interested in my neighbour, a long, thin
American, a Western man from Iowa I think, a school-master.
He told me he had been saving for years to get
money enough "to come across" (as he said) and hear
"Parsifal." He had taught himself German in the evenings
when his class was finished. The man was in such
a quiver of delighted anticipation that it was a pleasure
to see him. I told him I was sure he would not be disappointed,
as Van Dyck was to sing "Parsifal." There
were quite a number of priests at table, and one heard a
little French, but the talk was principally German and
English. We got up to the theatre easily enough, as
carriages were going backward and forward all the time.
The opera, "Parsifal," was beautifully given&mdash;Van Dyck
as good as ever. I always think he stands so wonderfully
in that scene where he has his back to the public
and is absorbed by all he sees. He told me it was one
of his most difficult parts. We had great difficulty in
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_385" title="pg 385"> </a>
getting our coffee between the acts, and greater still in
finding our carriage at the end. The crowd, and scramble,
and mud were something awful.</p>

<p class="author">Friday, August 6th.</p>

<p>We are leaving this afternoon, having had an enchanting
week. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, the
whole Ring beautifully given. All the music is racing
through my brain, from the lovely wave chorus of the
swimming Rhine maidens to the magnificent end of the
"G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung" with all the different motifs worked
in. They played the funeral march of "Siegfried" splendidly.
It is a curious life one leads here. In the morning
everybody walks about the town&mdash;the streets are narrow
and it is amusing to be hailed from windows over
small shops, grocers', bakers', watchmakers', by friends
who are lodging there. About 3 a sort of restless excitement
is in the air and one sees a long procession mounting
the hill to the Opera House, everyone absorbed by
the one idea. There are quantities of people we know.
I didn't go and see Mdme. Wagner this time, as Henrietta
and Pauline don't know her. Her evenings, the off
night, are very interesting. One sees all the distinguished
people of any kind at her house, all the artists,
critics, etc. Of course no one ventures to criticise the
<em>music</em>&mdash;merely the execution.</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">Meingeningen, Biebrich,</span><br >
Sunday, August 15, 1897.</p>

<p>I have been here two or three days and am glad to
have some quiet hours in the garden after the fatigue
and excitement of Bayreuth. Four Wagner operas in
succession is a strain on one's brain (not that I wouldn't
do it straight over again this week if I could, but one
wants the rest between). The crowd at Bayreuth the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_386" title="pg 386"> </a>
day we started was something wonderful, as of course
everyone leaves after their s&eacute;rie&mdash;there is nothing to do
or see in the town. At Nuremberg, too, the scramble
to get something to eat was funny, as there were two
courants, all of us leaving Bayreuth, and just as many
more arriving to take our places. There is always a
crowd at the Nuremberg station, though they have multiplied
little buffets outside the regular salles d'attente
with coffee, beer, sausages, etc. We were late all along
the line, and again there was such a crowd at the big
Frankfort station that I could not get my trunks in time
to take the first train for Mosbach&mdash;however, I arrived
finally and was pleased to see Heinrich's broad, good-humoured
face, and we drove at once to the house, where
Mary was waiting for me with supper. We talked a
little, but even that took us on to 2 o'clock, as it was
after midnight when I arrived.</p>

<p>We have seen various people, and made expeditions
to Wiesbaden. We wrote to the Empress Frederick's
lady-in-waiting the other day (Countess Perponcher,
whom Mary knows very well) to say that I was here
near Cronberg, and would be so pleased if the Empress
would receive me. The answer has just come, asking me
to lunch at Cronberg on Wednesday. I am delighted to
go&mdash;first to see the Empress, and then to see the house,
which is filled with beautiful things. The Empress has
travelled so much, and been so much in Italy, and has
bought all sorts of treasures.</p>

<p class="author">Tuesday, August 17, 1897.</p>

<p>Last night we went to the opera at Wiesbaden. It was
"Hansel and Gretel," beautifully given&mdash;the orchestra
very good and the angel scene with all the angels coming
down a sort of ladder and circling round the sleeping
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_387" title="pg 387"> </a>
children quite exquisite. It was a funny contrast to the
London and Paris Opera. Mary and I started off about
5.30 in ordinary summer dress&mdash;foulard and voile. We
went to the great confectioner at Wiesbaden for our tea
and cakes, and a little before 7 walked across to the
Opera. There we took off our hats and jackets, hung
them up on a little peg, found our seats without any
trouble, and had a very pleasant evening. The entr'actes
are much shorter than in France, so that we were out a
little before 10. The drive home was lovely on a bright
starlight summer night; about three-quarters of an
hour. It was such an easy, independent way of going,
without the complications of a man to go with us, servant
to take our cloaks, etc. I often think I should like
to live a little in Germany, there is so much that I like in
the country, and life seems so easy, though I believe German
women wouldn't say so. They all seemed weighed
down with cares, and apparently all with very small incomes.
I wonder if you have read Hauptmann's "Versunkene
Glocke"; I am fascinated by it. It was a little
difficult reading at first on account of the sort of patois,
but it is a wonderful book, so weird and full of sentiment.
I will finish my letter after our day at Cronberg.</p>

<p class="author">Thursday, August 19, 1897.</p>

<p>We had a charming day; I am so glad we went. We
started a little after ten for Frankfort, where we had a
wait of 20 minutes. I wore my black voile and a little
black and jet toque in which I put a white aigrette, and
white gloves, so as not to be too black. The trajet is
short from Frankfort to Cronberg, about an hour. We
found two carriages (rather pretty victorias in wood
natural colour and cushions the same colour&mdash;they looked
very chic and country) and tall powdered footmen in the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_388" title="pg 388"> </a>
black and silver Imperial livery. There were two or
three people in the second carriage whom I didn't recognise
at first, but made out when we arrived. Val Prinsep,
the artist, and his wife, a very pretty woman, and a German
lady, also an artist I think. The Castle is not far
from the station, and Cronberg (the town) is rather picturesque.
The house is large&mdash;nothing particular in the
way of architecture, but stands well in a fair-sized park.
We were received in a fine hall, with pictures, carvings,
and plenty of old furniture. Countess Perponcher and
Baron Reischach received us. Count Seckendorff was
not there, which I regretted, as I like him very much
and should have been glad to see him again. Countess
Perponcher took us to a small room on the ground floor
where we left our parasols, wraps, etc., and then we went
through one or two handsome rooms into a large salon
where the company was already assembled. Lady Layard
and her niece were staying in the house, also Prince
Albert Solms (our old friend) with his wife. He is
very ill, poor fellow, and can hardly get about. Some
English friends arrived from Hombourg&mdash;Lady Cork,
Lord Algy Lennox. About 1.30 the Empress came&mdash;always
the same charming manner, and always her sad
eyes. I thought she looked thinner and paler perhaps,
but not ill. We went immediately to luncheon&mdash;the Empress
first, alone, all of us following. Baron Reischach
sat opposite to her, between me and Lady Cork. The
talk was easy, the Empress talking a great deal. Val
Prinsep too did his share, and Lady Cork is always
clever and original. After luncheon we went back
to the big drawing-room and looked at some of the
beautiful things. Angeli's last portrait of the Empress
had just come and had been placed (temporarily only)
in a corner where the light was not very good. It
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_389" title="pg 389"> </a>
is a fine picture&mdash;the Empress all in black with her
splendid pearl necklace, seated on a sort of carved
throne, or high-backed chair&mdash;all the shading dark,
the only bit of colour the yellow ribbon of the Black
Eagle. It is a striking picture and very like her,
but so inexpressibly sad. She called each one of us in
turn to come and sit by her. She spoke very warmly
of W. to me, and asked me if I didn't regret my London
life, and if I did not find it very difficult to settle
down in France after having lived ten years in London,
"the great centre of the world." It is curious how universal
that feeling is with English people (and "au
fond," notwithstanding all the years she has lived in
Germany, the Empress is absolutely English still in her
heart). They think that life in England&mdash;London&mdash;spoils
one for everything else. I told her I didn't think
I was to be pitied for living in Paris&mdash;after all, my boy
was a Frenchman and all his interests were in France.
She asked about Francis, how old he was, and couldn't
believe that I was going back to f&ecirc;ter his 21 years, and
thought it was fortunate for him that his early education
had been in England.</p>

<p>We talked a little about French literature&mdash;I think
she reads everything&mdash;and she asked about Bayreuth,
were there many French people there. I told her the
Director of the Grand Op&eacute;ra, among others, who wants
to have the "Meistersinger" in France, but Mdme. Wagner
is rather unwilling&mdash;the choruses, she thinks, are too
difficult either to translate or to sing with the true spirit
in any other language. The Empress said, "She is quite
right; it is one of the most difficult of Wagner's operas,
and essentially German in plot and structure. It scarcely
bears translation in English and in French would be impossible;
neither is the music, in my mind, at all suited
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_390" title="pg 390"> </a>
to the French character. The mythical legend of the
Cycle would appeal more to the French, I think, than the
ordinary German life." I daresay she is right. When
she cong&eacute;died me I talked some little time to Prince
Solms, Reischach, and others. Then it was getting time
for us to go, as we had to take the 4.30 train back to
Frankfort. I was standing by the window, from which
there is a fine open view over plain and woods, when the
Empress came up to say good-bye. She supposed I was
going back to France, where I would find my boy. "You
are very fortunate to have him still with you; it gives
such an interest to your life." She kissed me, and then
said sadly, "<em>My</em> task is done&mdash;I am quite alone." I
watched her go out of the room, across the hall, and up
the great staircase, with her long black dress trailing behind,
alone&mdash;as she said. It must be an awful solitude
for her&mdash;living there in her beautiful house, filled with
art treasures of all kinds, and with friends near all summer
at Hombourg, Wiesbaden, etc., who are only too
happy to go to her&mdash;but her real life is over, and she is
as far away from Germany and the throbbing pulse of
the nation as if she were a cloistered nun.</p>

<p>The Val Prinseps came away with us, and we made a
bout de chemin together until they branched off to Hombourg.
He has quite the same idea of the Empress;
says "elle se ronge," that she had always had such aspirations
and wanted to do so much for the intellectual life
of Germany. Mary and I got to Frankfort in good time,
and home for dinner. We were glad to prowl about in
the garden after dinner, when it was deliciously cool and
the air heavy almost with the scent of roses, of which she
has quantities. We saw the Rhine and the lights of Mayence
in the distance. I suppose this place too I shall
never see again, as I think Mary has made up her mind
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_391" title="pg 391"> </a>
to sell Meingeningen. I think she will settle in Ireland
if she can get the old Townshend place where she was
one summer. It is ideal, close on the sea, with a splendid
park rising up behind the Castle, but will be a great
change for her.</p>

August 9, 1900.</p>

<p>We are becoming accustomed, Dear, to the wind and
rain and a general damp feeling. I don't think I have
been really dry since we left Paris. I live in my serge
dress and a waterproof. I should have been quite comfortable
if I could have changed with the other one, but
Bessie Talleyrand is disporting herself in it. When we
arrived we found everyone in mourning for the Duke of
Edinburgh, the first days not so marked, but since the
Osborne has arrived with the Prince and Princess on
board one sees nothing but black, and Bessie was much
disgusted, having only blue. The steam launches and
boats go all day between the yachts and the shore.
Everyone, men and women, wears those remarkable yellow
mackintoshes; you can't tell them apart, and the
boats look as if they were loaded with great yellow
"ballots." The two American yachts, Nahma, Mrs. Goelet,
and Itwana, Mr. Armour, are splendid, enormous
steamers and beautifully kept. Yesterday after lunch
Bessie and I started in the wind and rain to drive over to
Osborne and write ourselves down for the Queen. I am
afraid I sha'n't see her, which will be a great disappointment
to me; but the ladies here tell me she is much affected
by the Duke of Edinburgh's death, and after all,
the Prince has only just got back from his funeral. The
drive through Cowes is not very interesting, through
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_392" title="pg 392"> </a>
dirty, smelly little streets; but once over the ferry
(which one crosses in a boat large enough to take the
Queen's carriage with four horses) it is pretty enough,
up a long hill with fine trees and a few places. We didn't
see the Castle, as of course we were stopped at the gates,
which were open, with a policeman standing just inside.
The park looked fine, grass and flower beds beautifully
kept. We wrote ourselves down and I left a card for the
Duchess of Roxburghe, who is in waiting. We went
for tea to the Club garden, and there I saw the Duchess
of Roxburghe, who told me the Queen would certainly
see me. We dined quietly at home, rather a fancy meal,
but we prefer that to going out. There is a nice little
dining-room, and Joseph waits. How he gets on down-stairs
with the three maiden ladies who run the establishment
I don't know. He doesn't speak or understand
one word of English and has never been out of France
before. He went nearly mad over that remarkable railway
journey of ours across country from Eastbourne to
Cowes, where we changed about 10 times (all the luggage
naturally being transferred each time), lost all our
connections everywhere and arrived at Cowes at 10.30
at night, having left Eastbourne at 2. He is much impressed
with the uncleanliness of the house, and said to
me just now, "Si Madame voyait les torchons <em>sales</em> dont
on se sert pour essuyer les assiettes <em>propres</em>, Madame ne
mangerait jamais &agrave; la maison."</p>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">East Cowes</span>,<br >
Sunday, August 12, 1900.</p>

<p>I had two notes this morning, one from Miss Knollys
saying the Princess would receive me, and one from
Madame d'Arcos saying the Empress Eug&eacute;nie would
like us to come to tea with her on the Thistle at 5. I
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_393" title="pg 393"> </a>
had rather hesitated about writing myself down for the
Empress. I had never seen her, and W. was in such
violent opposition always to the Empire that I never saw
any of the Imperial family; but Madame d'Arcos said
Bessie and I were the only Frenchwomen at Cowes; we
had been everywhere&mdash;on the Osborne, to the Queen,
etc., and it was rude not to do the same thing for the
Empress&mdash;au fond, I was rather glad to have the opportunity,
as I had never seen her. We went to the club
garden after church, as I wanted to find a friend who
would lend me a steam launch to go out to the Osborne.
Lord Llangattock offered his, and also said he
would take us to the Thistle for tea, as they were going
on board to say good-bye to the Empress (they leave to-night).
I wore my black and white foulard and a big
black hat with feathers (never a sailor hat), which could
go, as the day was fine and the sea smooth. The Princess
was not there when I arrived; she had gone to the
service on the Victoria and Albert. Miss Knollys appeared
and we sat some time talking on deck. I was
leaning over the railing when the Royal launch arrived,
and I was astounded, after all these years (7), at the
appearance of the Princess. Just the same slight, youthful
figure and light step. The Duke of York came forward
first and talked a little. He was dressed in undress
admiral's uniform and looked very well. Then the Princess
came, quite unchanged. She was simply dressed, in
mourning, and looked quite as she did the last time I
saw her, when she was also in mourning (for Prince
Eddie). She kissed me, seemed pleased to see me, and
we sat on two straw chairs, under the awning on the
deck, talking about all sorts of things. She said the
Duke of Edinburgh's death was a great grief to them.
They were very fond of him, and it was sudden; and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_394" title="pg 394"> </a>
spoke most sadly about the Empress Frederick, who
seems to be dying, and of a cancer. It seems that she
knows quite well what is the matter with her and what
is before her, as she nursed her husband through his long
malady. Isn't it awful? She spoke about Francis, recalling
his first afternoon at Marlborough House, when
he was quite small and wept bitterly when the negro
minstrels appeared. I told her he was working for
diplomacy, and she said she would be much pleased to
see him when he came to London as attach&eacute;.</p>

<p class="center small">Entrance to the Club and Gardens, Cowes, Isle of Wight.<br>

<p>The Prince came and talked a little while, and also
recalled the last time we met last summer on the quai at
Nuremberg, both coming from Marienbad, and swallowing
hastily a cup of very hot coffee. I thought he
looked grave and preoccupied. He talked a little about
Cowes. He said he never remembered such a bad week&mdash;awful
weather and few yachts. He was very complimentary
about the two big American yachts, Itwana
and Nahma; said he had never seen the Nahma, which
he regretted, but he didn't know Mrs. Goelet&mdash;did I?
"Oh yes, very well, ever since she was a child, and her
mother and father before." I was sure she would be very
pleased to receive them. The Prince said they were in
such deep mourning that they had been on no yacht, and
he hoped there would be no party. I said Mrs. Goelet
herself was in deep mourning. After some consultation
with the Princess they said they would like to go on
board to-morrow morning at 12 o'clock (they leave early
Tuesday morning), and I promised to speak to Mrs.
Goelet.</p>

<p>He was amused when I said I liked the "Japs" so
much, as he rather invented them. They came to sing to
him one summer when he was ill at Cowes and on his
yacht all the time. There are four people, three women
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_395" title="pg 395"> </a>
and a man (a Frenchman), all masked, the women in
pretty Japanese dresses and the man in ordinary clothes.
One woman accompanies at the piano by heart, and extremely
well; the other two and the man sing and dance&mdash;dancing
very moderate&mdash;a sort of "walk around," but
the singing very good; all English except one or two
little French songs the man sings alone. One of their
favourite ditties, "Mary housemaid," always brings
down the house. It is just the sort of thing that would
have amused us in our young days when we used to play
and sing by heart and invent steps. The women are
very graceful&mdash;I don't know if they are pretty, as one
never sees their faces&mdash;and the man extraordinary, very
amusing and never vulgar.</p>

<p>I think I must have been a long time on the yacht, and
nothing could be more gracious and sympathetic than the
Princess. She told me the Queen would certainly receive
me. I hadn't more than time to get back where
Bessie and Borghese were very hungry waiting for
luncheon, and to start again at 4; this time with Bessie
and the Llangattocks for the Thistle. We were received
by Madame d'Arcos, Mlle. Darauvilliers, and M.
Rambaut. They told us the Empress had a cold and was
very hoarse; had been forbidden by the doctor to come
on deck, and also to talk, but that she would receive us
in the cabin. We went down almost immediately, preceded
by Madame d'Arcos, who said we must not stay
long, as the Empress ought not to talk. She was standing
in her cabin, still a handsome, stately figure, with
beautiful brow and eyes, and charming manner, more
animated than I had imagined. She was very well
dressed in black. She made us sit down and talked herself
a great deal, always about Paris, the Bassanos
(speaking most warmly of the Duke), d'Albuf&eacute;ras, and
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_396" title="pg 396"> </a>
various mutual friends. She knew Francis was to work
for diplomacy, and said she could wish him nothing better
than to walk in his father's footsteps. We were afraid
we were tiring her, as she talked all the time. Twice the
"dame d'honneur" appeared, but she waved her away.
When she finally dismissed us she said "Je ne dirai pas
adieu, mais au revoir"&mdash;regretted very much that she
could not come on deck and have tea with us, but that we
must certainly stay. We had a pleasant half hour talking
with the others, and then there came a message from
her begging that we would take her launch and cruise
about in the harbour. I accepted gladly, as I wanted to
communicate with the Nahma and didn't exactly know
how to manage. The French ladies too wished to see the
American yacht, so off we started in the Empress's launch.
It seemed funny after all these years to be suddenly
thrown with the Empress and her suite and careering
about in her launch. Mrs. Goelet was not on board, but
the steward took the visitors all over the yacht, and I discovered
Mrs. Warren and told her that the Prince and
Princess would like to go on board to-morrow&mdash;she said
she was quite sure her daughter would be very happy
to see them. I found a note from the Duchess of Roxburghe
when I got home, saying that the Queen would
receive me to-morrow at 4.30 at Osborne, so my day
will be full, as I told Mrs. Goelet I would come to the
Nahma to present her to the Prince and Princess.</p>


<h3><em>To H. L. K.</em></h3>

<p class="author"><span class="smcap">East Pavilion, Cowes, Isle of Wight</span>,<br >
Monday, August 13, 1900.</p>

<p>Well, Dear, I am just back from Osborne. I have the
salon all to myself, Bessie and Borghese are out, and I
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_397" title="pg 397"> </a>
will write you all about my audience while it is fresh in
my memory, but I must begin at the beginning and tell
you about the Royal visit to the Nahma, which went off
very well. A little before twelve Mr. Warren, Mrs. Goelet's
brother, came for us and we went off at once to the
yacht. The Royal party arrived very punctually, Prince
and Princess, Duke and Duchess of York, Princess Victoria,
and various gentlemen. They were all delighted
with the yacht, particularly the Duke of York, who saw
everything. He called an officer of the Osborne to see
some arrangement of signals which it seems is wonderful,
and said they had nothing so perfect in the Royal
Yacht. Mrs. Goelet did the honours very well and simply,
receiving the Princes at the gangway, with her son
and daughter on each side of her, a pretty, graceful figure
in her plain black dress. I remained on board to lunch
after the Princes departed, and they sent me ashore at
2.30 as I had just time to dress and go to Osborne.</p>

<p>I started again a little before 4, wearing my black
taffetas trimmed with lace and a tulle bonnet and white
aigrette (quite costume de ville&mdash;I could not go to the
Queen in a serge skirt and big hat). I took Joseph with
me in plain black livery. We arrived quite in time, as
there was no delay at the ferry this time, and the large
gates were open, the man making a sign to us to drive
in. There were two or three policemen standing near the
gate and in the park. The park is pretty&mdash;not very large
but beautifully green, and as we got near the house,
quantities of flowers&mdash;a mass of colour. The house is
not handsome&mdash;rather imposing, a large grey stone
house with two wings, and flower-beds close up to the
windows. Three or four footmen in plain black livery
were waiting in the hall, and they took me at once upstairs
to the ladies' drawing-room&mdash;a nice room at the
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_398" title="pg 398"> </a>
side of the house not looking out to sea. The Duchess
of Roxburghe was waiting for me, and we talked about
fifteen minutes. Then came a Highland servant saying,
"Her Majesty was ready to receive <em>Lady</em> Waddington."
The Duchess and I went downstairs, walked through
various galleries, and stopped at a door where there was
no servant. The Duchess knocked, the Queen's voice
said, "Come in," and I found myself in a beautiful large
salon, all the windows opening on the sea. The Queen,
dressed as usual in black, was seated in the middle of the
room facing the door. I had barely time to make one
curtsey&mdash;she put out her hand and made me sit down
next to her. She spoke to me first in French (just as
she always did when I was at the Embassy&mdash;to mark, I
suppose, that I was the French Ambassadress), "Je suis
tr&egrave;s heureuse de vous revoir&mdash;I think we can speak English&mdash;how
much has happened since we met"; and then
we talked about all sorts of things. I thought she looked
extremely well&mdash;of course I couldn't tell if her sight was
gone, as she knew I was coming and I sat close to her.
Her eyes were blue and clear, and her memory and conversation
quite the same. She thanked me for my letter;
said the Duke of Edinburgh's death was a great blow to
her. It was so sudden, she had not thought him ill. She
had lost three children all very dear to her, and it was
hard at her age to see her children go before her. She
spoke at once (so moderately) of the caricatures and
various little incidents that had occurred in France. I
said I was very glad to have an opportunity of telling
her that everybody in France (except for a few hot-headed
radicals and anti-English) was most indignant
at such gratuitous insults not only to the Queen but to
a woman. She said she quite understood that&mdash;that
wherever she had been in France everybody had done
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_399" title="pg 399"> </a>
what they could to make her stay happy and comfortable;
that she never could forget it, and hoped the French
nation felt that&mdash;also that she would never dream of
holding the country responsible for the radical press, but
"my children and my people feel it very deeply." We
talked about the King of Italy's murder (she was much
pleased with the expression in one of the Italian papers
"&egrave; morto in piedi") and she expressed great sympathy
for Queen Margherita&mdash;"She is fond of Italy and is always
thinking and planning what she can do for the
people." We also talked about the Shah and the attentat
in Paris. I said that left me rather indifferent, but she
answered instantly, "You are quite wrong&mdash;it is the
principle, not the person, that is attacked in those cases."
I then remarked that it was a great pity, I thought, that
one of those gentlemen (anarchists, not sovereigns)
shouldn't be lynched; that I believed the one thing they
were afraid of was the justice of the people. She said,
"That is not a very Christian sentiment"; but I think
she didn't altogether disagree with me. She asked me
about Francis&mdash;was he working for diplomacy; and then,
I don't know exactly how, we began talking about mixed
marriages. She said she didn't think religion ought to
be an invincible obstacle. I said I thought with her, but
that French Protestants were very strict. I told her it
had been said that my husband, who was certainly a very
large-minded man in most things, was really narrow
about Catholics. She said, with such a charming smile,
"Oh, I can't think M. Waddington was ever narrow
about anything, I always thought him one of the most
large-minded, just men I ever knew." I must say I was
pleased, and W. always felt that for some reason or
another he was sympathetic to her. We talked a little
about the Empress Frederick; she said the last news was
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_400" title="pg 400"> </a>
better, but she evidently didn't want to pursue the subject.
We talked on some little time, and when she finally
dismissed me, she said, "I hope you will come back to
England, and whenever you do I shall be very glad to see
you." She shook hands&mdash;I backed myself to the door,
opened it, and there found the Highland servant, who
took me back to the drawing-room where the Duchess
of Roxburghe was waiting. She suggested that we
should go for a turn in the garden, and when she went
to get her hat I looked about the room, which is quite
plainly furnished&mdash;a grand piano, comfortable furniture,
not pretty, and no particular style.</p>

<p>We walked about the gardens a little, which are pretty,
such quantities of flowers, and had tea under the trees.
Two of the ladies came out&mdash;Mrs. Grant and Miss
Harbord. They were very anxious to know if I found
the Queen changed after seven years, but I really can't
say I did. My impression is that they find her older.
They say she felt the Duke of Edinburgh's death very
much, and that she is very worried about the Empress
Frederick, though she doesn't talk much about her. It
was lovely sitting under the trees, so cool and quiet after
the noise and glare of Cowes. All the people bowed as
we drove home through Cowes. I think they took Joseph
in his black livery for one of the Queen's servants.</p>

<p>I must tell you that Joseph and &Eacute;lise are also moving
in high society. Joseph came with a most smiling face
to me Saturday night to say that one of his friends
was chef on the Empress's yacht (the Thistle) and had
invited them to breakfast on Sunday on the yacht. I
said they could go, and when Bessie and I were going to
church we saw them start&mdash;he in the regulation Cowes
blue serge costume (<em>not</em> the short, very short, Eton jacket
which is the dress attire of the Club men) and yellow
<a class="pagenum break" id="page_401" title="pg 401"> </a>
shoes, and she in my old purple foulard, with a very nice
little toque. A very smart little boat was waiting for
them.</p>

<p>Now, my Dear, I must stop, as I am exhausted, and a
perfect Mrs. Jellyby, papers flying all over the place, as
I am writing at the open window, and ink all over me,
fingers, hair, etc. I can't say, as Madame de S&eacute;vign&eacute;
did, "ma plume vole," for mine stops and scratches, and
makes holes in the paper, and does everything it can to
make my writing difficult. I wonder why I hate it so&mdash;I
do&mdash;as soon as I sit down to my writing-table I want
to go out or play on the piano, or even crochet little petticoats&mdash;anything
rather than write. I suppose I shall never see the Queen again&mdash;at
her age it isn't very likely, especially if I wait another seven years without coming
over. I am glad she received me, it was a great pleasure.</p>

<p>Of course I never saw the Queen again. She began
to fail that same autumn (1900) after her return home
from Balmoral, and died at Osborne the 22d of January,
1901&mdash;a beautiful death, painless, sleeping away and
all her children and grandchildren with her. It isn't only
the Queen who has disappeared&mdash;it is the century. England
will enter on a new phase&mdash;but it must be different
from the chapter that has just closed.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
